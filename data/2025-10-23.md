### [1] [The Black Tuesday Attack: how to crash the stock market with adversarial examples to financial forecasting models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18990)
*Thomas Hofweber,Jefrey Bergl,Ian Reyes,Amir Sadovnik*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过轻微操纵个股价格来制造对抗性样本，从而触发金融预测模型做出市场崩盘的自我实现预测的可能性。这种攻击难以检测，对金融稳定构成重大威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究金融预测模型面临对抗性攻击的脆弱性，揭示恶意行为者可能通过微小干预引发市场崩盘的风险，这种威胁目前被严重低估。

Method: 通过理论分析阐述攻击机制：轻微操纵个股价格形成对抗性样本，使金融预测模型产生崩盘预测，这种预测会自我实现。攻击可针对整个市场或单个公司。

Result: 研究发现这种对抗性攻击是可行的，能够引发难以检测的市场崩盘，对金融稳定构成严重威胁，需要紧急研究防御措施。

Conclusion: 金融预测模型面临的对抗性攻击威胁被严重低估，这种攻击能够通过微小干预引发大规模市场崩盘，迫切需要研究有效的防御策略。

Abstract: We investigate and defend the possibility of causing a stock market crash via
small manipulations of individual stock values that together realize an
adversarial example to financial forecasting models, causing these models to
make the self-fulfilling prediction of a crash. Such a crash triggered by an
adversarial example would likely be hard to detect, since the model's
predictions would be accurate and the interventions that would cause it are
minor. This possibility is a major risk to financial stability and an
opportunity for hostile actors to cause great economic damage to an adversary.
This threat also exists against individual stocks and the corresponding
valuation of individual companies. We outline how such an attack might proceed,
what its theoretical basis is, how it can be directed towards a whole economy
or an individual company, and how one might defend against it. We conclude that
this threat is vastly underappreciated and requires urgent research on how to
defend against it.

*Behnam Rezaei Bezanjani,Seyyed Hamid Ghafouri,Reza Gholamrezaei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种包含区块链加密、请求模式识别和BiLSTM入侵检测的三阶段方法，用于增强物联网医疗系统的安全性，在检测率、误报率等指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备在医疗领域的快速集成带来了革命性进步，但同时也引发了关键的安全问题，特别是医疗数据面临网络威胁的风险。敏感的健康信息需要强有力的保护措施来确保数据在物联网医疗环境中的机密性、完整性和可用性。

Method: 提出包含三个阶段的综合方法：第一阶段使用区块链支持的请求和交易加密加强数据交易安全；第二阶段引入请求模式识别检查，利用多样化数据源识别和阻止潜在未授权访问；第三阶段结合特征选择和BiLSTM网络，通过先进机器学习技术提高入侵检测的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在提高物联网医疗系统安全性方面表现出有效性，能够更好地保护医疗数据免受网络威胁。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices
into the healthcare sector has brought about revolutionary advancements in
patient care and data management. While these technological innovations hold
immense promise, they concurrently raise critical security concerns,
particularly in safeguarding medical data against potential cyber threats. The
sensitive nature of health-related information requires robust measures to
ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data in
IoT-enabled medical environments. Addressing the imperative need for enhanced
security in IoT-based healthcare systems, we propose a comprehensive method
encompassing three distinct phases. In the first phase, we implement
Blockchain-Enabled Request and Transaction Encryption to strengthen data
transaction security, providing an immutable and transparent framework. In the
second phase, we introduce a Request Pattern Recognition Check that leverages
diverse data sources to identify and block potential unauthorized access
attempts. Finally, the third phase incorporates Feature Selection and a BiLSTM
network to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of intrusion detection using
advanced machine learning techniques. We compared the simulation results of the
proposed method with three recent related methods: AIBPSF-IoMT, OMLIDS-PBIoT,
and AIMMFIDS. The evaluation criteria include detection rate, false alarm rate,
precision, recall, and accuracy - crucial benchmarks for assessing the overall
performance of intrusion detection systems. Our findings show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across all evaluated criteria,
demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the security of IoT-based
healthcare systems.

### [3] [Securing IoT Communications via Anomaly Traffic Detection: Synergy of Genetic Algorithm and Ensemble Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19121)
*Behnam Seyedi,Octavian Postolache*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于物联网网络安全的先进异常检测框架，通过数据预处理、遗传算法特征选择和集成分类器，实现了98%的准确率和95%的检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网网络的快速增长带来了安全威胁，如拒绝服务攻击、异常流量和数据篡改，由于去中心化架构和资源限制，需要有效的安全解决方案。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 使用中位数KS测试进行数据预处理；2) 结合鹰启发搜索策略的遗传算法进行特征选择；3) 集成决策树、随机森林和XGBoost的分类器进行异常检测。

Result: 实验结果显示98%的准确率、95%的检测率，假阳性率降低至10%，假阴性率降低至5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在提高物联网网络安全方面表现出高效性和鲁棒性，能够有效应对不断演变的网络威胁。

Abstract: The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed industries
by enabling seamless data exchange among connected devices. However, IoT
networks remain vulnerable to security threats such as denial of service (DoS)
attacks, anomalous traffic, and data manipulation due to decentralized
architectures and limited resources. To address these issues, this paper
proposes an advanced anomaly detection framework with three main phases. First,
data preprocessing is performed using the Median KS Test to remove noise,
handle missing values, and balance datasets for cleaner input. Second, a
feature selection phase employs a Genetic Algorithm combined with eagle
inspired search strategies to identify the most relevant features, reduce
dimensionality, and improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Finally,
an ensemble classifier integrates Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
algorithms to achieve accurate and reliable anomaly detection. The proposed
model demonstrates high adaptability and scalability across diverse IoT
environments. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing methods by
achieving 98 percent accuracy, 95 percent detection rate, and reductions in
false positive (10 percent) and false negative (5 percent) rates. These results
confirm the framework effectiveness and robustness in improving IoT network
security against evolving cyber threats.

### [4] [HAMLOCK: HArdware-Model LOgically Combined attacK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19145)
*Sanskar Amgain,Daniel Lobo,Atri Chatterjee,Swarup Bhunia,Fnu Suya*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: HAMLOCK是一种硬件-软件结合的隐蔽后门攻击，将攻击逻辑分布在硬件和软件边界，比传统模型级后门攻击更隐蔽且能绕过现有防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型级后门攻击容易被检测，因为整个攻击逻辑都嵌入在模型中，存在可追踪的逐层激活路径。需要开发更隐蔽的攻击方式来规避检测。

Method: 在软件层面轻微调整少数神经元的激活值，使其在特定触发器出现时产生独特的高激活值；在硬件层面通过恶意硬件木马监控这些神经元的最高有效位或8位指数，检测到独特激活后直接操纵最终输出logits进行错误分类。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10、GTSRB和ImageNet等基准测试中，HAMLOCK实现了接近完美的攻击成功率，且对清洁准确率影响可忽略。能绕过最先进的模型级防御，硬件木马面积和功耗开销低至0.01%。

Conclusion: HAMLOCK暴露了硬件-软件接口的关键漏洞，需要开发新的跨层防御机制来应对这种新兴威胁。

Abstract: The growing use of third-party hardware accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) for
deep neural networks (DNNs) introduces new security vulnerabilities.
Conventional model-level backdoor attacks, which only poison a model's weights
to misclassify inputs with a specific trigger, are often detectable because the
entire attack logic is embedded within the model (i.e., software), creating a
traceable layer-by-layer activation path.
  This paper introduces the HArdware-Model Logically Combined Attack (HAMLOCK),
a far stealthier threat that distributes the attack logic across the
hardware-software boundary. The software (model) is now only minimally altered
by tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation
values when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those
unique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant
bit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly
manipulate the final output logits for misclassification.
  This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no
complete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears
fully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible
clean accuracy drop. More importantly, HAMLOCK circumvents the state-of-the-art
model-level defenses without any adaptive optimization. The hardware Trojan is
also undetectable, incurring area and power overheads as low as 0.01%, which is
easily masked by process and environmental noise. Our findings expose a
critical vulnerability at the hardware-software interface, demanding new
cross-layer defenses against this emerging threat.

### [5] [OpenGuardrails: An Open-Source Context-Aware AI Guardrails Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19169)
*Thomas Wang,Haowen Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: OpenGuardrails是一个开源项目，提供上下文感知的安全和操作检测模型，以及可部署的AI护栏平台，保护LLM免受内容安全风险、模型操作攻击和数据泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的集成度提高，保护它们免受不安全、恶意或侵犯隐私的内容变得至关重要。

Method: 使用统一的大模型实现内容安全和模型操作检测，使用轻量级NER管道（如Presidio风格模型或基于正则表达式的检测器）进行数据泄露识别和编辑。系统可作为安全网关或基于API的服务部署。

Result: 在安全基准测试中达到最先进性能，在英语、中文和多语言任务中的提示和响应分类表现出色。

Conclusion: OpenGuardrails为LLM提供了全面的安全保护，所有模型都在Apache 2.0许可下公开发布供使用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, safeguarding them against unsafe, malicious, or
privacy-violating content is critically important. We present OpenGuardrails,
the first open-source project to provide both a context-aware safety and
manipulation detection model and a deployable platform for comprehensive AI
guardrails. OpenGuardrails protects against content-safety risks,
model-manipulation attacks (e.g., prompt injection, jailbreaking,
code-interpreter abuse, and the generation/execution of malicious code), and
data leakage. Content-safety and model-manipulation detection are implemented
by a unified large model, while data-leakage identification and redaction are
performed by a separate lightweight NER pipeline (e.g., Presidio-style models
or regex-based detectors). The system can be deployed as a security gateway or
an API-based service, with enterprise-grade, fully private deployment options.
OpenGuardrails achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on safety
benchmarks, excelling in both prompt and response classification across
English, Chinese, and multilingual tasks. All models are released under the
Apache 2.0 license for public use.

### [6] [Defending Against Prompt Injection with DataFilter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19207)
*Yizhu Wang,Sizhe Chen,Raghad Alkhudair,Basel Alomair,David Wagner*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DataFilter是一种针对LLM代理的提示注入防御方法，通过在数据到达后端LLM之前移除恶意指令，实现模型无关的实时防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理被广泛部署与不可信外部数据交互，提示注入成为重大安全威胁。现有防御方法要么需要模型权重访问权限，要么造成显著效用损失，要么需要复杂的系统重构。

Method: 使用监督微调在模拟注入数据上训练DataFilter，结合用户指令和数据内容，选择性去除对抗性内容同时保留良性信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DataFilter持续将提示注入攻击成功率降低至接近零，同时保持LLM的效用。

Conclusion: DataFilter提供了强大的安全性、高实用性和即插即用部署能力，是保护黑盒商业LLM免受提示注入攻击的实用防御方案。

Abstract: When large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate
tasks and interact with untrusted external data, prompt injection emerges as a
significant security threat. By injecting malicious instructions into the data
that LLMs access, an attacker can arbitrarily override the original user task
and redirect the agent toward unintended, potentially harmful actions. Existing
defenses either require access to model weights (fine-tuning), incur
substantial utility loss (detection-based), or demand non-trivial system
redesign (system-level). Motivated by this, we propose DataFilter, a test-time
model-agnostic defense that removes malicious instructions from the data before
it reaches the backend LLM. DataFilter is trained with supervised fine-tuning
on simulated injections and leverages both the user's instruction and the data
to selectively strip adversarial content while preserving benign information.
Across multiple benchmarks, DataFilter consistently reduces the prompt
injection attack success rates to near zero while maintaining the LLMs'
utility. DataFilter delivers strong security, high utility, and plug-and-play
deployment, making it a strong practical defense to secure black-box commercial
LLMs against prompt injection. Our DataFilter model is released at
https://huggingface.co/JoyYizhu/DataFilter for immediate use, with the code to
reproduce our results at https://github.com/yizhu-joy/DataFilter.

### [7] [LAPRAD: LLM-Assisted PRotocol Attack Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19264)
*R. Can Aygun,Yehuda Afek,Anat Bremler-Barr,Leonard Kleinrock*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LAPRAD是一种利用LLM辅助发现协议漏洞的新方法，成功发现了DNS协议中的三种新型DDoS攻击，这些攻击能够绕过现有补丁并严重降低解析器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高互联网协议安全性，开发更快、半自动的方法来发现DNS、BGP等协议中的新漏洞。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 使用GPT-o1识别潜在攻击；2) 通过LangChain和ReACT方法自动构建攻击配置；3) 验证攻击功能性和有效性。

Result: 发现了三种新的DNS DDoS攻击：诱饵切换技术缓存虚假DNSSEC RRSIGs、利用大型DNSSEC加密算法绕过RRSet限制、利用ANY类型响应。这些攻击能将解析器服务能力降至6%。

Conclusion: LAPRAD方法有效，发现的SigCacheFlush攻击变种能够规避现有补丁，严重影响主流DNS解析器实现的最新版本。

Abstract: With the goal of improving the security of Internet protocols, we seek
faster, semi-automatic methods to discover new vulnerabilities in protocols
such as DNS, BGP, and others. To this end, we introduce the LLM-Assisted
Protocol Attack Discovery (LAPRAD) methodology, enabling security researchers
with some DNS knowledge to efficiently uncover vulnerabilities that would
otherwise be hard to detect.
  LAPRAD follows a three-stage process. In the first, we consult an LLM
(GPT-o1) that has been trained on a broad corpus of DNS-related sources and
previous DDoS attacks to identify potential exploits. In the second stage, a
different LLM automatically constructs the corresponding attack configurations
using the ReACT approach implemented via LangChain (DNS zone file generation).
Finally, in the third stage, we validate the attack's functionality and
effectiveness.
  Using LAPRAD, we uncovered three new DDoS attacks on the DNS protocol and
rediscovered two recently reported ones that were not included in the LLM's
training data. The first new attack employs a bait-and-switch technique to
trick resolvers into caching large, bogus DNSSEC RRSIGs, reducing their serving
capacity to as little as 6%. The second exploits large DNSSEC encryption
algorithms (RSA-4096) with multiple keys, thereby bypassing a recently
implemented default RRSet limit. The third leverages ANY-type responses to
produce a similar effect.
  These variations of a cache-flushing DDoS attack, called SigCacheFlush,
circumvent existing patches, severely degrade resolver query capacity, and
impact the latest versions of major DNS resolver implementations.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一个面向5G/6G网络的容错和弹性感知框架，通过AI异常检测、自适应路由和冗余机制来缓解网络攻击下的级联故障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的5G/6G网络基础设施对关键任务服务的依赖日益增加，需要提高可靠性和对复杂网络物理威胁的弹性。这些网络由于分布式智能、虚拟化资源和跨域集成而面临新的攻击面。

Method: 整合AI驱动的异常检测、自适应路由和冗余机制，使用NS-3仿真进行验证，分析可靠性、延迟、弹性指数和丢包率等关键性能指标。

Result: 所提出的框架显著改善了故障恢复能力，稳定了数据包传输，并减少了服务中断，相比基线方法表现更好。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效增强5G/6G网络在面临网络物理攻击时的容错能力和弹性表现。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on AI-driven 5G/6G network infrastructures for
mission-critical services highlights the need for reliability and resilience
against sophisticated cyber-physical threats. These networks are highly exposed
to novel attack surfaces due to their distributed intelligence, virtualized
resources, and cross-domain integration. This paper proposes a fault-tolerant
and resilience-aware framework that integrates AI-driven anomaly detection,
adaptive routing, and redundancy mechanisms to mitigate cascading failures
under cyber-physical attack conditions. A comprehensive validation is carried
out using NS-3 simulations, where key performance indicators such as
reliability, latency, resilience index, and packet loss rate are analyzed under
various attack scenarios. The deduced results demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly improves fault recovery, stabilizes packet delivery,
and reduces service disruption compared to baseline approaches.

### [9] [An Adaptive Intelligent Thermal-Aware Routing Protocol for Wireless Body Area Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19300)
*Abdollah Rahimi,Mehdi Jafari Shahbazzadeh,Amid Khatibi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一种智能温度感知和可靠性路由方法，通过两阶段优化WBAN性能：网络设置与智能路径选择、动态流量管理与热点避免。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最短路径路由在WBAN中导致特定节点拥塞和过热，造成早期故障。需要解决有限能量、动态拓扑和节点温度敏感性等挑战。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段节点共享剩余能量、温度、链路可靠性和延迟信息，使用多标准决策算法构建优化拓扑；第二阶段实时监控并重新路由流量避开过热或耗尽节点。

Result: 相比现有方法，吞吐量提高13%，端到端延迟降低10%，能耗减少25%，路由负载降低30%。

Conclusion: 所提出的温度感知和可靠性路由方法能有效提升WBAN性能，解决传统路由的局限性。

Abstract: Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have gained significant attention due to
their applications in healthcare monitoring, sports, military communication,
and remote patient care. These networks consist of wearable or implanted
sensors that continuously collect and transmit physiological data, requiring
efficient and reliable communication. However, WBANs face challenges such as
limited energy, dynamic topology, and sensitivity to node temperature, which
demand specialized routing strategies. Traditional shortest-path routing often
causes congestion and overheating in specific nodes, leading to early failures.
To address these problems, this paper proposes an intelligent temperature-aware
and reliability-based routing approach that enhances WBAN performance. The
proposed method works in two phases: (1) network setup and intelligent path
selection, and (2) dynamic traffic management and hotspot avoidance. In the
first phase, nodes share information such as residual energy, temperature, link
reliability, and delay to build an optimized topology using a multi-criteria
decision algorithm. The second phase continuously monitors real-time conditions
and reroutes traffic away from overheated or depleted nodes. Simulation results
show that the proposed approach improves throughput by 13 percent, reduces
end-to-end delay by 10 percent, decreases energy consumption by 25 percent, and
lowers routing load by 30 percent compared to existing methods.

### [11] [Authorization of Knowledge-base Agents in an Intent-based Management Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19324)
*Loay Abdelrazek,Leyli Karaçay,Marin Orlic*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强的授权框架，将上下文和功能属性与代理角色相结合，实现动态、策略驱动的访问控制，确保代理仅获得对知识图谱的最小必要权限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在6G网络中，基于意图的管理系统需要简化网络管理，但确保代理的安全和细粒度授权在动态多租户环境中仍然是一个重大挑战。传统访问控制模型缺乏适应意图操作所需的灵活性和粒度。

Method: 通过分析代理功能，将上下文和功能属性与代理角色集成，实现动态、策略驱动的访问控制框架。

Result: 该框架能够确保代理仅获得对知识图谱的最小必要权限，提高了授权机制的灵活性和安全性。

Conclusion: 提出的增强授权框架能够有效解决6G网络中基于意图管理系统的代理授权挑战，为动态多租户环境提供了更安全、灵活的访问控制方案。

Abstract: As networks move toward the next-generation 6G, Intent-based Management (IbM)
systems are increasingly adopted to simplify and automate network management by
translating high-level intents into low-level configurations. Within these
systems, agents play a critical role in monitoring current state of the
network, gathering data, and enforcing actions across the network to fulfill
the intent. However, ensuring secure and fine-grained authorization of agents
remains a significant challenge, especially in dynamic and multi-tenant
environments. Traditional models such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC),
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and Relational-Based Access Control
(RelBAC) often lack the flexibility to accommodate the evolving context and
granularity required by intentbased operations. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced authorization framework that integrates contextual and functional
attributes with agent roles to achieve dynamic, policy-driven access control.
By analyzing agent functionalities, our approach ensures that agents are
granted only the minimal necessary privileges towards knowledge graphs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用概率计算来改进基于格子的因式分解算法中的CVP近似优化步骤，结果显示该方法在问题规模上线性时间内能找到最优CVP近似，且比类似量子/经典方法减少高达100倍的格实例使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的研究探索在基于格子的因式分解算法中加入启发式CVP近似优化步骤，使用量子变分算法进行启发式优化。这与概率计算作为随机算法硬件加速器的出现相吻合。本文旨在研究概率计算在基于格子因式分解的CVP近似优化任务中的应用。

Conclusion: 概率计算在基于格子的因式分解中CVP近似优化任务中表现出色，显著减少了所需的计算资源，为格基密码学和整数分解问题提供了高效的启发式优化解决方案。

Abstract: The closest vector problem (CVP) is a fundamental optimization problem in
lattice-based cryptography and its conjectured hardness underpins the security
of lattice-based cryptosystems. Furthermore, Schnorr's lattice-based factoring
algorithm reduces integer factoring (the foundation of current cryptosystems,
including RSA) to the CVP. Recent work has investigated the inclusion of a
heuristic CVP approximation `refinement' step in the lattice-based factoring
algorithm, using quantum variational algorithms to perform the heuristic
optimization. This coincides with the emergence of probabilistic computing as a
hardware accelerator for randomized algorithms including tasks in combinatorial
optimization. In this work we investigate the application of probabilistic
computing to the heuristic optimization task of CVP approximation refinement in
lattice-based factoring. We present the design of a probabilistic computing
algorithm for this task, a discussion of `prime lattice' parameters, and
experimental results showing the efficacy of probabilistic computing for
solving the CVP as well as its efficacy as a subroutine for lattice-based
factoring. The main results found that (a) this approach is capable of finding
the maximal available CVP approximation refinement in time linear in problem
size and (b) probabilistic computing used in conjunction with the lattice
parameters presented can find the composite prime factors of a semiprime number
using up to 100x fewer lattice instances than similar quantum and classical
methods.

*Mete Harun Akcay,Buse Gul Atli,Siddharth Prakash Rao,Alexandros Bakas*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种可信数据共享系统架构，通过策略驱动的访问控制实现敏感区域的选择性保护，结合自动检测、后校正、密钥管理和访问控制模块，在视觉数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着存储数据量增长，在大规模存储库中识别和保护敏感信息变得日益困难，特别是在与具有不同角色和权限的多个用户共享时。

Method: 集成四个核心模块：自动敏感区域检测、后校正、密钥管理和访问控制。采用混合加密方案，结合对称加密的高效性和基于属性加密的策略执行，支持高效密钥分发和隔离存储。

Result: 系统在视觉数据集上有效检测隐私敏感对象，宏观平均F1分数提升5%，平均精度均值提升10%，策略强制解密时间平均每张图像小于1秒。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案在细粒度访问控制方面具有有效性、高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: As the volume of stored data continues to grow, identifying and protecting
sensitive information within large repositories becomes increasingly
challenging, especially when shared with multiple users with different roles
and permissions. This work presents a system architecture for trusted data
sharing with policy-driven access control, enabling selective protection of
sensitive regions while maintaining scalability. The proposed architecture
integrates four core modules that combine automated detection of sensitive
regions, post-correction, key management, and access control. Sensitive regions
are secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for
efficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system
supports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen
overall security. To demonstrate its applicability, we evaluate the system on
visual datasets, where Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images are automatically
detected, reassessed, and selectively encrypted prior to sharing in a data
repository. Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO
detection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision
(10%), and maintains an average policy-enforced decryption time of less than 1
second per image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and
scalability of our proposed solution for fine-grained access control.

popular paradigm of AI applications. However, trustworthiness issues in MAS
remain a critical concern. Unlike challenges in single-agent systems, MAS
involve more complex communication processes, making them susceptible to
corruption attacks. To mitigate this issue, several defense mechanisms have
been developed based on the graph representation of MAS, where agents represent
nodes and communications form edges. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly
focus on static graph defense, attempting to either detect attacks in a fixed
graph structure or optimize a static topology with certain defensive
capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic defense paradigm
for MAS graph structures, which continuously monitors communication within the
MAS graph, then dynamically adjusts the graph topology, accurately disrupts
malicious communications, and effectively defends against evolving and diverse
dynamic attacks. Experimental results in increasingly complex and dynamic MAS
environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MAS
defense mechanisms, contributing an effective guardrail for their trustworthy
applications. Our code is available at

### [15] [Transmitter Identification via Volterra Series Based Radio Frequency Fingerprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19440)
*Rundong Jiang,Jun Hu,Zhiyuan Xie,Yunqi Song,Shiyou Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Volterra级数和子波分解的射频指纹识别方法，通过建模发射机硬件失真特征，在LoRa数据集上实现了超过98%的静态信道准确率和90%以上的多径/多普勒效应下准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有射频指纹识别方法缺乏统一理论框架，手工特征或直接神经网络分类导致泛化性和可解释性受限，需要更有效的硬件特征提取方法。

Method: 将发射机建模为黑盒，用Volterra级数表示接收信号，通过子波分解近似核函数，使用最小二乘拟合估计系数，最后用复数神经网络进行分类。

Result: 在公开LoRa数据集上达到最先进性能：静态信道准确率>98%，多径和多普勒效应下准确率>90%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过硬件失真建模和子波分解，显著提高了射频指纹识别的可解释性和跨信道条件的泛化能力。

Abstract: The growing number of wireless devices increases the need for secure network
access. Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF), a physical-layer authentication
method, offers a promising solution as it requires no cryptography and resists
spoofing. However, existing RFF approaches often lack a unified theory and
effective feature extraction. Many methods use handcrafted signal features or
direct neural network classification, leading to limited generalization and
interpretability. In this work, we model the transmitter as a black box and
analyze its impact on transmitted signals. By treating the deviation from an
ideal signal as hardware-induced distortion, we represent the received signal
using a Volterra series, using its kernels to capture linear and nonlinear
hardware traits. To manage the high dimensionality of these kernels, we
approximate them via wavelet decomposition and estimate coefficients through
least-squares fitting. The resulting wavelet coefficients provide compact yet
informative hardware representations, which are classified using a
complex-valued neural network. Experiments on a public LoRa dataset show
state-of-the-art performance, with over 98% accuracy in static channels and
above 90% under multipath and Doppler effects. The proposed approach improves
both interpretability and generalization across varying channel conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MCP智能家居代理工具链的安全问题，需要检测协议级别的入侵行为。

Method: 开发了NEBULA-Schema框架将MCP活动表示为流式异构时序图，并构建了基于新颖性、会话DAG结构和属性线索的CPU专用流式检测器。

Result: 在模拟智能家居测试平台上，AegisMCP实现了亚秒级窗口模型推理和端到端警报，在边缘硬件上性能优于流量和序列基线。

Abstract: In this work, we study security of Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent
toolchains and their applications in smart homes. We introduce AegisMCP, a
protocol-level intrusion detector. Our contributions are: (i) a minimal attack
suite spanning instruction-driven escalation, chain-of-tool exfiltration,
malicious MCP server registration, and persistence; (ii) NEBULA-Schema
(Network-Edge Behavioral Learning for Untrusted LLM Agents), a reusable
protocol-level instrumentation that represents MCP activity as a streaming
heterogeneous temporal graph over agents, MCP servers, tools, devices, remotes,
and sessions; and (iii) a CPU-only streaming detector that fuses novelty,
session-DAG structure, and attribute cues for near-real-time edge inference,
with optional fusion of local prompt-guardrail signals. On an emulated
smart-home testbed spanning multiple MCP stacks and a physical bench, AegisMCP
achieves sub-second per-window model inference and end-to-end alerting. The
latency of AegisMCP is consistently sub-second on Intel N150-class edge
hardware, while outperforming traffic-only and sequence baselines; ablations
confirm the importance of DAG and install/permission signals. We release code,
schemas, and generators for reproducible evaluation.

### [17] [Cross-Chain Sealed-Bid Auctions Using Confidential Compute Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19491)
*Jonas Gebele,Timm Mutzel,Burak Oez,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可信执行环境(TEE)的密封投标拍卖协议，在机密计算区块链上执行投标逻辑，同时在公共链上进行结算和执行，解决了传统密封投标拍卖中的隐私、可验证性和可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密封投标拍卖依赖中心化基础设施，存在不透明操纵风险；而公共区块链虽然消除中心控制，但其透明度与密封投标的机密性要求相冲突。现有方案难以在不依赖可信中介、多轮协议或昂贵密码学的情况下平衡隐私、可验证性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用TEE支持的机密计算区块链执行敏感投标逻辑，投标人将资金提交到由enclave生成的托管地址。截止后，任何方均可触发解决方案：机密区块链通过可验证的链下计算确定获胜者，并签发签名的结算交易在公共链上执行。

Result: 该设计在不依赖可信第三方或协议修改的情况下提供了安全性、隐私性和可扩展性。在SUAVE上实现并与以太坊结算集成，评估了可扩展性和信任假设，展示了在现有基础设施上部署的最小集成需求。

Conclusion: 提出的协议成功解决了密封投标拍卖中的核心挑战，通过TEE和区块链的结合实现了隐私保护、可验证性和可扩展性的平衡，为去中心化拍卖系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Sealed-bid auctions ensure fair competition and efficient allocation but are
often deployed on centralized infrastructure, enabling opaque manipulation.
Public blockchains eliminate central control, yet their inherent transparency
conflicts with the confidentiality required for sealed bidding. Prior attempts
struggle to reconcile privacy, verifiability, and scalability without relying
on trusted intermediaries, multi-round protocols, or expensive cryptography. We
present a sealed-bid auction protocol that executes sensitive bidding logic on
a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-backed confidential compute blockchain
while retaining settlement and enforcement on a public chain. Bidders commit
funds to enclave-generated escrow addresses, ensuring confidentiality and
binding commitments. After the deadline, any party can trigger resolution: the
confidential blockchain determines the winner through verifiable off-chain
computation and issues signed settlement transactions for execution on the
public chain. Our design provides security, privacy, and scalability without
trusted third parties or protocol modifications. We implement it on SUAVE with
Ethereum settlement, evaluate its scalability and trust assumptions, and
demonstrate deployment with minimal integration on existing infrastructure

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型计算和能耗需求增长，同时云端模型执行存在数据隐私问题，需要更高效安全的加密方法。

Method: 将密文转换为脉冲序列，利用时间神经动态建模加密和解密过程，优化密钥长度、脉冲时序和突触连接等参数。

Result: 相比AES-128、RSA-2048和DES，BioEncryptSNN在保持数据完整性的同时，加密解密速度比PyCryptodome的AES实现快4.1倍。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在对称和非对称密码中的可扩展性和适应性，表明SNNs是安全、节能计算的有前景方向。

Abstract: Deep learning is widely applied to modern problems through neural networks,
but the growing computational and energy demands of these models have driven
interest in more efficient approaches. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), the
third generation of neural networks, mimic the brain's event-driven behaviour,
offering improved performance and reduced power use. At the same time, concerns
about data privacy during cloud-based model execution have led to the adoption
of cryptographic methods. This article introduces BioEncryptSNN, a spiking
neural network based encryption-decryption framework for secure and
noise-resilient data protection. Unlike conventional algorithms, BioEncryptSNN
converts ciphertext into spike trains and exploits temporal neural dynamics to
model encryption and decryption, optimising parameters such as key length,
spike timing, and synaptic connectivity. Benchmarked against AES-128, RSA-2048,
and DES, BioEncryptSNN preserved data integrity while achieving up to 4.1x
faster encryption and decryption than PyCryptodome's AES implementation. The
framework demonstrates scalability and adaptability across symmetric and
asymmetric ciphers, positioning SNNs as a promising direction for secure,
energy-efficient computing.

### [19] [CircuitGuard: Mitigating LLM Memorization in RTL Code Generation Against IP Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19676)
*Nowfel Mashnoor,Mohammad Akyash,Hadi Kamali,Kimia Azar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CircuitGuard是一个针对LLM在RTL代码生成中记忆问题的防御策略，通过RTL感知相似性度量和激活级引导方法，在减少知识产权泄露的同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在RTL硬件综合中倾向于记忆训练数据，导致专有或安全敏感设计在推理过程中意外暴露，存在知识产权泄露风险。RTL代码的独特特性使得传统自然语言记忆检测方法不适用。

Method: 1) 引入新颖的RTL感知相似性度量，捕捉结构性和功能性等价性；2) 开发激活级引导方法，识别并衰减对记忆最关键的transformer组件。

Result: 在Llama 3.1-8B模型中识别出275个记忆关键特征，实现与专有模式语义相似度降低80%，同时保持生成质量。跨领域转移效果达78-85%。

Conclusion: CircuitGuard能有效平衡泄露减少与正确性保持，为RTL代码生成中的记忆问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generative
tasks, including register-transfer level (RTL) hardware synthesis. However,
their tendency to memorize training data poses critical risks when proprietary
or security-sensitive designs are unintentionally exposed during inference.
While prior work has examined memorization in natural language, RTL introduces
unique challenges: In RTL, structurally different implementations (e.g.,
behavioral vs. gate-level descriptions) can realize the same hardware, leading
to intellectual property (IP) leakage (full or partial) even without verbatim
overlap. Conversely, even small syntactic variations (e.g., operator precedence
or blocking vs. non-blocking assignments) can drastically alter circuit
behavior, making correctness preservation especially challenging. In this work,
we systematically study memorization in RTL code generation and propose
CircuitGuard, a defense strategy that balances leakage reduction with
correctness preservation. CircuitGuard (1) introduces a novel RTL-aware
similarity metric that captures both structural and functional equivalence
beyond surface-level overlap, and (2) develops an activation-level steering
method that identifies and attenuates transformer components most responsible
for memorization. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that CircuitGuard
identifies (and isolates) 275 memorization-critical features across layers
18-28 of Llama 3.1-8B model, achieving up to 80% reduction in semantic
similarity to proprietary patterns while maintaining generation quality.
CircuitGuard further shows 78-85% cross-domain transfer effectiveness, enabling
robust memorization mitigation across circuit categories without retraining.

### [20] [Exploring the Effect of DNN Depth on Adversarial Attacks in Network Intrusion Detection Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19761)
*Mohamed ElShehaby,Ashraf Matrawy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究深度神经网络层数增加对网络入侵检测系统(NIDS)和计算机视觉领域对抗攻击鲁棒性的影响，发现在NIDS领域增加层数会显著降低鲁棒性，而在计算机视觉领域影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗攻击对机器学习系统特别是深度神经网络构成严重威胁，本研究旨在探索在网络入侵检测系统(NIDS)领域中，增加神经网络层深是否会影响其对对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 比较不同深度神经网络在NIDS和计算机视觉两个领域中对对抗攻击的鲁棒性表现，通过实验分析层数增加对鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 在NIDS领域，增加层数不仅不能提升性能，反而会显著降低对抗攻击鲁棒性；而在计算机视觉领域，层数增加对鲁棒性的影响相对温和。

Conclusion: 研究结果可为开发鲁棒的NIDS神经网络提供指导，并突显了网络安全领域在机器学习环境中的独特性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges to Machine Learning (ML)
systems and especially Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by subtly manipulating
inputs to induce incorrect predictions. This paper investigates whether
increasing the layer depth of deep neural networks affects their robustness
against adversarial attacks in the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
domain. We compare the adversarial robustness of various deep neural networks
across both \ac{NIDS} and computer vision domains (the latter being widely used
in adversarial attack experiments). Our experimental results reveal that in the
NIDS domain, adding more layers does not necessarily improve their performance,
yet it may actually significantly degrade their robustness against adversarial
attacks. Conversely, in the computer vision domain, adding more layers exhibits
a more modest impact on robustness. These findings can guide the development of
robust neural networks for (NIDS) applications and highlight the unique
characteristics of network security domains within the (ML) landscape.

Abstract: The integration of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices into
manufacturing environments has accelerated the transition to Industry 4.0, but
has also introduced new cybersecurity risks. This paper conducts a
comprehensive security analysis of a commercial smart air compressor, revealing
critical vulnerabilities including hardcoded credentials, unauthenticated APIs,
and an insecure update mechanism. It includes a formal threat model,
demonstrates practical attack scenarios in a testbed environment, and evaluates
their subsequent impact on an industrial process, leading to denial of service
and the corruption of critical process telemetry. In addition, an analysis of
the device's supply chain reveals how product integration from multiple vendors
and limited security considerations can expose a device to threats. The
findings underscore the necessity of incorporating cybersecurity principles
into both IIoT device design and supply chain governance to enhance resilience
against emerging industrial cyber threats.

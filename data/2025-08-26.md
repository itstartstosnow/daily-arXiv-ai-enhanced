Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一种结合遗传算法和粒子群优化的混合元启发式方法，用于无线传感器网络的节能可靠节点部署，在减少15-25%传感器节点的同时保持95%以上区域覆盖和连接性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线传感器网络中高效可靠的节点部署对于优化区域覆盖、节点连接性和能源效率至关重要，需要解决覆盖与能耗之间的平衡问题。

Method: 采用遗传算法(GA)和粒子群优化(PSO)的混合方法，结合GA的强大探索能力和PSO的快速收敛特性。

Result: 与单独使用GA或PSO相比，GA-PSO混合方法需要减少15-25%的传感器节点，同时保持95%以上的区域覆盖和连接性；在长传感和通信范围内优于CMOMPA算法。

Conclusion: 混合元启发式方法能有效提升WSN性能，为环境监测、智慧城市、智能农业等实际应用提供了有前景的解决方案，未来研究方向包括异构节点部署和移动WSN等。

Abstract: Efficient and reliable node deployment in Wireless Sensor Networks is crucial
for optimizing coverage of the area, connectivity among nodes, and energy
efficiency. This paper proposes a hybrid meta heuristic approach combining a
Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to address the
challenges of energy efficient and reliable node deployment. The GA PSO hybrid
leverages GAs strong exploration capabilities and PSOs rapid convergence,
achieving an optimum stability between coverage and energy consumption. The
performance of the proposed approach is evaluated against GA and PSO alone and
the innovatory meta heuristic based Competitive Multi Objective Marine
Predators Algorithm (CMOMPA) across varying sensing ranges. Simulation results
demonstrate that GA PSO requires 15% to 25% fewer sensor nodes and maintains
95% or more area coverage while maintaining the connectivity in comparison to
standalone GA or PSO algorithm. The proposed algorithm also dominates CMOMPA
when compared for long sensing and communication range in terms of higher
coverage, improved connectivity, and reduced deployment time while requiring
fewer sensor nodes. This study also explores key trade offs in WSN deployment
and highlights future research directions, including heterogeneous node
deployment, mobile WSNs, and enhanced multi objective optimization techniques.
The findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid meta heuristics in
improving WSN performance, offering a promising approach for real world
applications such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, smart agriculture,
disaster response, and IIoT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI漏洞检测系统在未知代码库上的泛化性能通常较差，限制了其实际应用效果，需要研究如何提升跨项目检测能力。

Method: 通过一系列实验，分析数据集多样性和质量对检测性能的影响，并比较编码器模型和解码器模型在漏洞检测任务上的表现。

Result: 模型在BigVul基准数据集上召回率提升6.8%，在未见过的项目上也表现优异，显示出增强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 数据质量和模型选择对构建鲁棒的漏洞检测系统至关重要，为开发具有高跨项目有效性的未来系统指明了方向。

Abstract: The performance of AI-based software vulnerability detection systems is often
limited by their poor generalization to unknown codebases. In this research, we
explore the impact of data quality and model architecture on the
generalizability of vulnerability detection systems. By generalization we mean
ability of high vulnerability detection performance across different C/C++
software projects not seen during training. Through a series of experiments, we
demonstrate that improvements in dataset diversity and quality substantially
enhance detection performance. Additionally, we compare multiple encoder-only
and decoder-only models, finding that encoder based models outperform in terms
of accuracy and generalization. Our model achieves 6.8% improvement in recall
on the benchmark BigVul[1] dataset, also outperforming on unseen projects,
hence showing enhanced generalizability. These results highlight the role of
data quality and model selection in the development of robust vulnerability
detection systems. Our findings suggest a direction for future systems having
high cross-project effectiveness.

### [3] [Passive Hack-Back Strategies for Cyber Attribution: Covert Vectors in Denied Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16637)

Conclusion: 建议采用混合防御框架，结合被动归因与有条件主动响应，在遵守法律和道德约束的同时提升网络防御效能，AI和量子技术是未来重要发展方向。

Abstract: Attributing cyberattacks remains a central challenge in modern cybersecurity,
particularly within denied environments where defenders have limited visibility
into attacker infrastructure and are restricted by legal or operational rules
of engagement. This perspective examines the strategic value of passive
hack-back techniques that enable covert attribution and intelligence collection
without initiating direct offensive actions. Key vectors include tracking
beacons, honeytokens, environment-specific payloads, and supply-chain-based
traps embedded within exfiltrated or leaked assets. These approaches rely on
the assumption that attackers will interact with compromised data in traceable
ways, allowing defenders to gather signals without violating engagement
policies. The paper also explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
enhancing passive hack-back operations. Topics include the deployment of
autonomous agents for forensic reconnaissance, the use of Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate dynamic payloads, and Adversarial Machine Learning (AML)
techniques for evasion and counter-deception. A dedicated section discusses the
implications of quantum technologies in this context, both as future threats to
cryptographic telemetry and as potential tools for stealthy communication and
post-quantum resilience. Finally, the paper advocates for hybrid defensive
frameworks that combine passive attribution with delayed or conditional active
responses, while maintaining compliance with legal, ethical, and operational
constraints.

Abstract: Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has become a widely adopted model for securing
enterprise environments, promoting continuous verification and minimal trust
across systems. However, its application in mobile contexts remains limited,
despite mobile applications now accounting for most global digital interactions
and being increasingly targeted by sophisticated threats. Existing Zero Trust
frameworks developed by organisations such as the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) primarily focus on enterprise-managed infrastructure,
assuming organisational control over devices, networks, and identities. This
paper addresses a critical gap by proposing an extended Zero Trust model
designed for mobile applications operating in untrusted, user-controlled
environments. Using a design science methodology, the study introduced a
six-pillar framework that supports runtime enforcement of trust through
controls including device integrity, user identity validation, data protection,
secure application programming interface (API) usage, behavioural monitoring,
and live application protection. Each pillar was mapped to relevant regulatory
and security standards to support compliance. A phased implementation roadmap
and maturity assessment model were also developed to guide adoption across
varying organisational contexts. The proposed model offers a practical and
standards-aligned approach to securing mobile applications beyond
pre-deployment controls, aligning real-time enforcement with Zero Trust
principles. This contribution expands the operational boundaries of ZTA and
provides organisations with a deployable path to reduce fraud, enhance
compliance, and address emerging mobile security challenges. Future research
may include empirical validation of the framework and cross-sector application
testing.

### [5] [Securing Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) Communications for Wildfire Management: Mitigating the Effects of Adversarial and Environmental Threats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16761)
*Nesrine Benchoubane,Olfa Ben Yahia,William Ferguson,Gurkan Gur,Sumit Chakravarty,Gregory Falco,Gunes Karabulut Kurt*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的异构网络框架，通过整合低轨道卫星、高空平台和低空平台来建立安全号弹性的野火管理通信系统，并分析了环境压力和窃听者对秘密容量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对恶劣环境条件和网络威胁，重要应用如野火管理需要安全号弹的通信系统以确保任务成功。

Method: 扩展之前的组件化安全方法，在异构网络中整合LEO卫星、HAPGS和LAPS，并通过安全RF/FSO管理和各种链路来保护通信层。

Result: 环境压力如大气衰减和光束偏移会显著降低秘密容量，高空窃听者受影响较小从而提高了截获能力，增加发射功率反而可能优化窃听者收益。

Conclusion: 论文强调了同时应对环境和网络威胁的重要性，并符合IEEE P3536标准，确保系统号弹性和任务成功。

Abstract: In the face of adverse environmental conditions and cyber threats, robust
communication systems for critical applications such as wildfire management and
detection demand secure and resilient architectures. This paper presents a
novel framework that considers both adversarial factors, building resilience
into a heterogeneous network (HetNet) integrating Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
satellite constellation with High-Altitude Platform Ground Stations (HAPGS) and
Low-Altitude Platforms (LAPS), tailored to support wildfire management
operations. Building upon our previous work on secure-by-component approach for
link segment security, we extend protection to the communication layer by
securing both Radio Frequency (RF)/Free Space Optics (FSO) management and
different links. Through a case study, we quantify how environmental stressors
impact secrecy capacity and expose the system to passive adversaries. Key
findings demonstrate that atmospheric attenuation and beam misalignment can
notably degrade secrecy capacity across both short- and long-range
communication links, while high-altitude eavesdroppers face less signal
degradation, increasing their interception capability. Moreover, increasing
transmit power to counter environmental losses can inadvertently improve
eavesdropper reception, thereby reducing overall link confidentiality. Our work
not only highlights the importance of protecting networks from these dual
threats but also aligns with the IEEE P3536 Standard for Space System
Cybersecurity Design, ensuring resilience and the prevention of mission
failures.

### [6] [Guarding Your Conversations: Privacy Gatekeepers for Secure Interactions with Cloud-Based AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16765)
*GodsGift Uzor,Hasan Al-Qudah,Ynes Ineza,Abdul Serwadda*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出LLM门卫概念，在本地运行轻量级模型过滤用户查询中的敏感信息，再发送到云端LLM，在保证响应质量的同时显著提升隐私保护


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM交互性强导致用户分享大量个人信息，但隐私设置在弱隐私法律、政府监控或数据安全差的地区保护有限，存在敏感信息泄露风险

Method: 设计本地运行的轻量级LLM门卫模型，在用户查询发送到云端LLM前过滤掉敏感信息，采用双模型架构

Result: 通过人类受试者实验证明，该方法引入的开销极小，显著增强用户隐私，且不影响LLM响应质量

Conclusion: LLM门卫是一种有效的隐私保护方案，在不可信的云端LLM环境下为用户提供可靠的隐私保障

Abstract: The interactive nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which closely track
user data and context, has prompted users to share personal and private
information in unprecedented ways. Even when users opt out of allowing their
data to be used for training, these privacy settings offer limited protection
when LLM providers operate in jurisdictions with weak privacy laws, invasive
government surveillance, or poor data security practices. In such cases, the
risk of sensitive information, including Personally Identifiable Information
(PII), being mishandled or exposed remains high. To address this, we propose
the concept of an "LLM gatekeeper", a lightweight, locally run model that
filters out sensitive information from user queries before they are sent to the
potentially untrustworthy, though highly capable, cloud-based LLM. Through
experiments with human subjects, we demonstrate that this dual-model approach
introduces minimal overhead while significantly enhancing user privacy, without
compromising the quality of LLM responses.

Abstract: Voice authentication has undergone significant changes from traditional
systems that relied on handcrafted acoustic features to deep learning models
that can extract robust speaker embeddings. This advancement has expanded its
applications across finance, smart devices, law enforcement, and beyond.
However, as adoption has grown, so have the threats. This survey presents a
comprehensive review of the modern threat landscape targeting Voice
Authentication Systems (VAS) and Anti-Spoofing Countermeasures (CMs), including
data poisoning, adversarial, deepfake, and adversarial spoofing attacks. We
chronologically trace the development of voice authentication and examine how
vulnerabilities have evolved in tandem with technological advancements. For
each category of attack, we summarize methodologies, highlight commonly used
datasets, compare performance and limitations, and organize existing literature
using widely accepted taxonomies. By highlighting emerging risks and open
challenges, this survey aims to support the development of more secure and
resilient voice authentication systems.

Conclusion: 目标性磨损攻击是一种有效的硬件老化攻击手段，能够通过软件控制故意加速特定功能单元的老化，导致计算错误和数据损坏，对处理器安全性构成新的威胁。

Abstract: Negative-Bias Temperature Instability is a dominant aging mechanism in
nanoscale CMOS circuits such as microprocessors. With this aging mechanism, the
rate of device aging is dependent not only on overall operating conditions,
such as heat, but also on user controllable inputs to the transistors. This
dependence on input implies a possible timing fault-injection attack wherein a
targeted path of logic is intentionally degraded through the purposeful,
software-driven actions of an attacker, rendering a targeted bit effectively
stuck.
  In this work, we describe such an attack mechanism, which we dub a
"$\textbf{Targeted Wearout Attack}$", wherein an attacker with sufficient
knowledge of the processor core, executing a carefully crafted software program
with only user privilege, is able to degrade a functional unit within the
processor with the aim of eliciting a particular desired incorrect calculation
in a victim application. Here we give a general methodology for the attack. We
then demonstrate a case study where a targeted path within the fused
multiply-add pipeline in a RISC-V CPU sees a $>7x$ increase in wear over time
than would be experienced under typical workloads. We show that an attacker
could leverage such an attack, leading to targeted and silent data corruption
in a co-running victim application using the same unit.

Method: 开发ReckDetector自动识别带红包功能的应用，从4个应用市场收集334款应用的36万余条用户评论，使用BERT模型识别负面评论并进行语义分析

Result: 识别出用户抱怨的6种红包欺诈类型，发现红包欺诈普遍存在，无良开发者广泛利用红包作为欺骗性激励机制

Conclusion: 红包欺诈严重影响用户体验和应用声誉，需要更多关注和监管措施

Abstract: With the popularization of smartphones, red packets have been widely used in
mobile apps. However, the issues of fraud associated with them have also become
increasingly prominent. As reported in user reviews from mobile app markets,
many users have complained about experiencing red packet fraud and being
persistently troubled by fraudulent red packets. To uncover this phenomenon, we
conduct the first investigation into an extensive collection of user reviews on
apps with red packets. In this paper, we first propose a novel automated
approach, ReckDetector, for effectively identifying apps with red packets from
app markets. We then collect over 360,000 real user reviews from 334 apps with
red packets available on Google Play and three popular alternative Android app
markets. We preprocess the user reviews to extract those related to red packets
and fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model to identify negative reviews. Finally,
based on semantic analysis, we have summarized six distinct categories of red
packet fraud issues reported by users. Through our study, we found that red
packet fraud is highly prevalent, significantly impacting user experience and
damaging the reputation of apps. Moreover, red packets have been widely
exploited by unscrupulous app developers as a deceptive incentive mechanism to
entice users into completing their designated tasks, thereby maximizing their
profits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机广泛应用但飞行路径隐私面临威胁，现有加密技术无法防止元数据分析导致的轨迹推断攻击

Result: 能够有效防止实时追踪、身份暴露和未经授权拦截，提升无人机在对抗环境中的操作安全性

Conclusion: 该方案在隐私、安全和计算效率之间取得平衡，适用于民用和军事领域资源受限的无人机

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for military,
commercial, and logistics applications has raised significant concerns
regarding flight path privacy. Conventional UAV communication systems often
expose flight path data to third parties, making them vulnerable to tracking,
surveillance, and location inference attacks. Existing encryption techniques
provide security but fail to ensure complete privacy, as adversaries can still
infer movement patterns through metadata analysis. To address these challenges,
we propose a zk-SNARK(Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of
Knowledge)-based privacy-preserving flight path authentication and verification
framework. Our approach ensures that a UAV can prove its authorisation,
validate its flight path with a control centre, and comply with regulatory
constraints without revealing any sensitive trajectory information. By
leveraging zk-SNARKs, the UAV can generate cryptographic proofs that verify
compliance with predefined flight policies while keeping the exact path and
location undisclosed. This method mitigates risks associated with real-time
tracking, identity exposure, and unauthorised interception, thereby enhancing
UAV operational security in adversarial environments. Our proposed solution
balances privacy, security, and computational efficiency, making it suitable
for resource-constrained UAVs in both civilian and military applications.

Motivation: 量子计算的发展对依赖传统加密算法（如SHA-256和ECDSA）的区块链构成了严重威胁，需要找到对抗量子攻击的解决方案。

Method: 通过评估量子计算对现有区块链技术的威胁，探讨后量子加密技术在区块链中的应用，以构建后量子区块链。

Abstract: Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that offers numerous
benefits including decentralization, transparency, efficiency, and reduced
costs. Hence, blockchain has been included in many fields. Blockchain relies on
cryptographic protocols (especially public-key cryptography and hash functions)
to achieve many essential sub-routines. However, the increased progress of
quantum computation and algorithms has threatened the security of many
traditional cryptosystems. Therefore, this represents a serious risk for the
existing blockchain technology. For example, SHA-256 and the Elliptic Curve
Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) cryptosystems can be compromised by Shor s
and Grover s quantum algorithms in the foreseeable future. Post-Quantum
Cryptography (PQC) is a basic solution for resisting these quantum attacks.
Applying PQC to blockchains results in creating Post-Quantum Blockchains (PQB).
Thus, this paper aims to review the threats imposed by quantum computers on
classical blockchain technology and provide useful guidelines on PQB security
to blockchain researchers. The paper focuses on the challenges and
opportunities of future work direction in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频水印在版权保护和溯源追踪中应用广泛，但由于音频信号的固有特性，水印定位和抗去同步攻击仍然是重大挑战。

Method: 设计了帧级广播嵌入策略，可在任意长度音频中嵌入水印；引入精心设计的失真层增强鲁棒性；采用扩张残差块和扩张门控块捕获多分辨率时频特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，SyncGuard能高效处理变长音频段，在各种攻击下的鲁棒性优于现有最先进方法，并提供卓越的听觉质量。

Conclusion: SyncGuard成功解决了音频水印的关键挑战，为音频版权保护提供了有效的技术方案。

Abstract: Audio watermarking has been widely applied in copyright protection and source
tracing. However, due to the inherent characteristics of audio signals,
watermark localization and resistance to desynchronization attacks remain
significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a learning-based scheme named
SyncGuard to address these challenges. Specifically, we design a frame-wise
broadcast embedding strategy to embed the watermark in arbitrary-length audio,
enhancing time-independence and eliminating the need for localization during
watermark extraction. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a
meticulously designed distortion layer. Additionally, we employ dilated
residual blocks in conjunction with dilated gated blocks to effectively capture
multi-resolution time-frequency features. Extensive experimental results show
that SyncGuard efficiently handles variable-length audio segments, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in robustness against various attacks, and delivers
superior auditory quality.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统分析了LLM智能代理中的TOCTOU（检查时与使用时之间）漏洞，提出了TOCTOU-Bench基准测试和三种防御方法，将漏洞从12%降至8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能代理的广泛应用，安全漏洞问题日益突出。虽然已有研究关注提示注入和数据泄露等威胁，但TOCTOU漏洞在LLM代理场景中尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 1) 构建TOCTOU-Bench基准测试，包含66个真实用户任务；2) 提出三种防御方法：提示重写、状态完整性监控和工具融合；3) 评估自动化检测方法的有效性。

Result: 自动化检测方法达到25%的检测准确率，脆弱计划生成减少3%，攻击窗口缩小95%。综合三种方法后，TOCTOU漏洞从12%降至8%。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLM智能代理中TOCTOU漏洞的重要性，提出了有效的检测和缓解方法，为AI安全与系统安全的交叉研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled agents are rapidly emerging across a wide
range of applications, but their deployment introduces vulnerabilities with
security implications. While prior work has examined prompt-based attacks
(e.g., prompt injection) and data-oriented threats (e.g., data exfiltration),
time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) remain largely unexplored in this
context. TOCTOU arises when an agent validates external state (e.g., a file or
API response) that is later modified before use, enabling practical attacks
such as malicious configuration swaps or payload injection. In this work, we
present the first study of TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM-enabled agents. We
introduce TOCTOU-Bench, a benchmark with 66 realistic user tasks designed to
evaluate this class of vulnerabilities. As countermeasures, we adapt detection
and mitigation techniques from systems security to this setting and propose
prompt rewriting, state integrity monitoring, and tool-fusing. Our study
highlights challenges unique to agentic workflows, where we achieve up to 25%
detection accuracy using automated detection methods, a 3% decrease in
vulnerable plan generation, and a 95% reduction in the attack window. When
combining all three approaches, we reduce the TOCTOU vulnerabilities from an
executed trajectory from 12% to 8%. Our findings open a new research direction

### [15] [Exposing Privacy Risks in Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17222)
*Jiale Liu,Jiahao Zhang,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文研究发现Graph RAG系统虽然减少了原始文本泄露风险，但对结构化实体和关系信息的提取更加脆弱，揭示了新的隐私风险并探讨了防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph RAG作为增强LLM的先进范式，利用图结构知识提供更丰富的回答，但从文档检索转向图遍历引入了未被充分探索的隐私风险，需要研究其数据提取漏洞。

Method: 设计并执行定制化的数据提取攻击，测试Graph RAG系统对原始文本和结构化数据（实体及其关系）泄露的敏感性。

Result: 发现Graph RAG系统在减少原始文本泄露的同时，对结构化实体和关系信息的提取显著更加脆弱，存在关键的安全权衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作为Graph RAG独特的隐私挑战提供了基础分析，并为构建更安全的系统提供了见解，同时探索了潜在的防御机制来缓解这些新的攻击面。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enhancing
Large Language Models (LLMs) with external, up-to-date knowledge. Graph RAG has
emerged as an advanced paradigm that leverages graph-based knowledge structures
to provide more coherent and contextually rich answers. However, the move from
plain document retrieval to structured graph traversal introduces new,
under-explored privacy risks. This paper investigates the data extraction
vulnerabilities of the Graph RAG systems. We design and execute tailored data
extraction attacks to probe their susceptibility to leaking both raw text and
structured data, such as entities and their relationships. Our findings reveal
a critical trade-off: while Graph RAG systems may reduce raw text leakage, they
are significantly more vulnerable to the extraction of structured entity and
relationship information. We also explore potential defense mechanisms to
mitigate these novel attack surfaces. This work provides a foundational
analysis of the unique privacy challenges in Graph RAG and offers insights for
building more secure systems.

*Adi Mutha,Jitendra Sandu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 量子计算对区块链加密货币构成安全威胁，Shor和Grover算法分别威胁公钥密码系统和哈希函数，需要采用后量子密码学等防护措施


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，基于区块链的加密货币面临日益严重的密码学漏洞风险，需要评估量子算法对加密货币安全机制的影响

Method: 通过文献综述方法，分析Shor和Grover算法对比特币、以太坊等主流加密货币的威胁，评估量子硬件限制和攻击可行性时间表

Result: 发现量子计算机虽尚未构成即时威胁，但公钥密码系统和哈希函数都存在特定漏洞，需要提前部署防护措施

Conclusion: 加密货币必须主动采用后量子密码标准，以维护区块链的去中心化信任、完整性和安全性

Abstract: With the advent of quantum computing, cryptocurrencies that rely on
blockchain technology face mounting cryptographic vulnerabilities. This paper
presents a comprehensive literature review evaluating how quantum algorithms,
specifically Shors and Grovers, could disrupt the foundational security
mechanisms of cryptocurrencies. Shors algorithm poses a threat to public-key
cryptographic schemes by enabling efficient factorization and discrete
logarithm solving, thereby endangering digital signature systems. Grovers
algorithm undermines hash-based functions, increasing the feasibility of fifty
one percent attacks and hash collisions. By examining the internal mechanisms
of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, and
Zcash, this review identifies specific vulnerabilities in transaction and
consensus processes. It further analyses the current hardware limitations of
quantum systems and estimates when such attacks could become feasible. In
anticipation, it investigates countermeasures including Post-Quantum
Cryptography (PQC), Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and protocol-level
modifications such as memory-intensive proof-of-work algorithms and
multi-signature schemes. The discussion integrates recent advancements in
quantum error correction, hardware scalability, and NIST-standardized
cryptographic algorithms. This review concludes that while quantum computers
are not yet advanced enough to pose an immediate threat, proactive integration
of quantum-resistant solutions is essential. The findings underscore the urgent
need for cryptocurrencies to adopt post-quantum cryptographic standards to
preserve the decentralized trust, integrity, and security that define
blockchain-based digital cryptocurrencies.

*Muhammad Ibn Ziauddin,Rownak Rahad Rabbi,SM Mehrab,Fardin Faiyaz,Mosarrat Jahan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种突破性的动态窗口长度模型，通过调和平均值和高效聚类算法，解决了传统IoT信任计算中的窗口选择、信任波动和推荐过滤效率低等问题，在攻击检测准确性和时间效率方面取得显著改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前IoT信任计算机制存在三个主要问题：滑动窗口方案无法确保可靠信任计算；偏重近期信任导致整体信任分数突变，容易误判；聚类机制导致推荐过滤速度慢。需要一种更加稳健的信任模型来解决这些限制。

Method: 提出了一种动态确定窗口长度的方法，保证准确信任计算。使用平均信任分数和时间的调和平均值来防止信任分数的突然波动。采用高效的个性化子空间聚类算法来排除不可靠推荐。

Result: 安全分析显示该方案能够有效抵御恶意评击、投票塞塞和开关攻击。在检测恶意评击攻击方面表现竞争力，而在检测开关攻击方面比现有方案准确性提高44%。在多重攻击同时发生的情况下仍能保持有效性，并将推荐过滤时间减少95%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的突破性信任模型通过动态窗口长度、调和平均值和高效聚类算法，有效解决了传统IoT信任计算中的关键问题，在攻击检测准确性、系统稳健性和过滤效率方面都取得了显著改进，为IoT安全提供了更可靠的信任计算方案。

Abstract: Trust computation is crucial for ensuring the security of the Internet of
Things (IoT). However, current trust-based mechanisms for IoT have limitations
that impact data security. Sliding window-based trust schemes cannot ensure
reliable trust computation due to their inability to select appropriate window
lengths. Besides, recent trust scores are emphasized when considering the
effect of time on trust. This can cause a sudden change in overall trust score
based on recent behavior, potentially misinterpreting an honest service
provider as malicious and vice versa. Moreover, clustering mechanisms used to
filter recommendations in trust computation often lead to slower results. In
this paper, we propose a robust trust model to address these limitations. The
proposed approach determines the window length dynamically to guarantee
accurate trust computation. It uses the harmonic mean of average trust score
and time to prevent sudden fluctuations in trust scores. Additionally, an
efficient personalized subspace clustering algorithm is used to exclude
recommendations. We present a security analysis demonstrating the resiliency of
the proposed scheme against bad-mouthing, ballot-stuffing, and on-off attacks.
The proposed scheme demonstrates a competitive performance in detecting
bad-mouthing attacks, while outperforming existing works with an approximately
44% improvement in accuracy for detecting on-off attacks. It maintains its
effectiveness even when the percentage of on-off attackers increases and in
scenarios where multiple attacks occur simultaneously. Additionally, the
proposed scheme reduces the recommendation filtering time by 95%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在高风险应用中暴露出系统性安全挑战，需要一种覆盖全生命周期的动态风险评估和协同防御框架来应对隐私泄露、偏见放大和恶意滥用等问题。

Method: 设计了动态风险评估系统，使用熵杂权重计算敏感词频率、API调用异常、实时风险熵值和上下文偏离等指标。在输入层使用BERT-CRF混合模型识别和过滤恶意命令，模型层采用动态对抗训练和差分隐私噪声注入技术，输出层配备神经水印系统进行内容源头追踪。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种综合性的解决方案，通过动态风险评估、多层防御技术和协同保护机制，有效应对大语言模型在关键应用场景中的安全挑战。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expose systemic security challenges in high
risk applications, including privacy leaks, bias amplification, and malicious
abuse, there is an urgent need for a dynamic risk assessment and collaborative
defence framework that covers their entire life cycle. This paper focuses on
the security problems of large language models (LLMs) in critical application
scenarios, such as the possibility of disclosure of user data, the deliberate
input of harmful instructions, or the models bias. To solve these problems, we
describe the design of a system for dynamic risk assessment and a hierarchical
defence system that allows different levels of protection to cooperate. This
paper presents a risk assessment system capable of evaluating both static and
dynamic indicators simultaneously. It uses entropy weighting to calculate
essential data, such as the frequency of sensitive words, whether the API call
is typical, the realtime risk entropy value is significant, and the degree of
context deviation. The experimental results show that the system is capable of
identifying concealed attacks, such as role escape, and can perform rapid risk
evaluation. The paper uses a hybrid model called BERT-CRF (Bidirectional
Encoder Representation from Transformers) at the input layer to identify and
filter malicious commands. The model layer uses dynamic adversarial training
and differential privacy noise injection technology together. The output layer
also has a neural watermarking system that can track the source of the content.
In practice, the quality of this method, especially important in terms of
customer service in the financial industry.

identified regarding the design processes and the methodological rigour,
including lack of systematic design, misalignment between proposed and achieved
learning outcomes, rare use of control groups, limited discussions on ethical
considerations, and underutilisation of emerging technologies. We recommend
multiple future research directions, e.g., a hybrid approach to game design and
evaluation that combines bottom-up and top-down approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究主要关注特定威胁，而忽视了攻击在机器人互联系统中的漏洞传播问题。人形机器人依赖传统网络软件栈和迅空更新通道，具有独特的安全风险特征。

Method: 构建了一个七层安全模型，整合了39种已知攻击和35种防御措施，并发展了一个量化的39x35攻击防御矩阵，使用风险加权评分和蒙特卡罗分析验证。

Result: 对Pepper、G1 EDU和Digit三款真实机器人进行了评估，安全成熟度得分范围从39.9%到79.5%不等，显示了不同平台的安全水平差异。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种结构化、基于证据的安全评估方法，支持跨平台对比分析和安全投资优先级判断，为人形机器人安全领域做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Humanoids are progressing toward practical deployment across healthcare,
industrial, defense, and service sectors. While typically considered
cyber-physical systems (CPSs), their dependence on traditional networked
software stacks (e.g., Linux operating systems), robot operating system (ROS)
middleware, and over-the-air update channels, creates a distinct security
profile that exposes them to vulnerabilities conventional CPS models do not
fully address. Prior studies have mainly examined specific threats, such as
LiDAR spoofing or adversarial machine learning (AML). This narrow focus
overlooks how an attack targeting one component can cascade harm throughout the
robot's interconnected systems. We address this gap through a systematization
of knowledge (SoK) that takes a comprehensive approach, consolidating
fragmented research from robotics, CPS, and network security domains. We
introduce a seven-layer security model for humanoid robots, organizing 39 known
attacks and 35 defenses across the humanoid ecosystem-from hardware to
human-robot interaction. Building on this security model, we develop a
quantitative 39x35 attack-defense matrix with risk-weighted scoring, validated
through Monte Carlo analysis. We demonstrate our method by evaluating three
real-world robots: Pepper, G1 EDU, and Digit. The scoring analysis revealed
varying security maturity levels, with scores ranging from 39.9% to 79.5%
across the platforms. This work introduces a structured, evidence-based
assessment method that enables systematic security evaluation, supports
cross-platform benchmarking, and guides prioritization of security investments
in humanoid robotics.

### [21] [Attacking LLMs and AI Agents: Advertisement Embedding Attacks Against Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17674)
*Qiming Guo,Jinwen Tang,Xingran Huang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型LLM安全威胁——广告嵌入攻击(AEA)，通过劫持第三方服务平台和发布后门开源模型两种低成本方式，在模型输出中隐秘注入广告或恶意内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全研究主要关注准确性下降问题，而忽视了信息完整性的威胁。AEA攻击能够在不影响模型正常表现的情况下植入隐蔽的推广内容、宣传或仇恨言论，这种安全漏洞尚未得到充分重视。

Method: 采用两种攻击向量：(1)劫持第三方服务分发平台，前置对抗性提示词；(2)发布经过攻击者数据微调的后门开源模型检查点。同时提出了基于提示词的自检防御方法，无需额外模型重训练。

Result: 研究发现AEA攻击能够有效植入隐蔽的恶意内容，揭示了LLM安全中存在一个紧急且未被充分解决的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: AEA攻击暴露了LLM安全的重要缺陷，需要AI安全社区在检测、审计和政策响应方面进行协调应对，以保护信息完整性。

Abstract: We introduce Advertisement Embedding Attacks (AEA), a new class of LLM
security threats that stealthily inject promotional or malicious content into
model outputs and AI agents. AEA operate through two low-cost vectors: (1)
hijacking third-party service-distribution platforms to prepend adversarial
prompts, and (2) publishing back-doored open-source checkpoints fine-tuned with
attacker data. Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert
information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate
speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five
stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection
defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining.
Our findings reveal an urgent, under-addressed gap in LLM security and call for
coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety
community.

TL;DR: TLGLock是一种基于阈值逻辑门和电荷回收技术的新型硬件逻辑锁定方案，相比传统方法在面积、延迟、功耗和SAT攻击抗性方面都有显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前硬件逻辑锁定方法在可扩展性和设计开销方面面临挑战，需要一种更高效、更安全的解决方案来防止硬件盗版

Method: 利用阈值逻辑门的结构表达能力和电荷回收的能量效率，在门级实现密钥依赖的功能，通过动态电荷共享和权重逻辑嵌入密钥

Result: 相比锁存器方案节省30%面积、50%延迟和20%功耗；相比XOR和SFLL-HD方法提供3倍SAT攻击抗性；错误密钥下可达100%输出损坏

Conclusion: TLGLock提供了一个无状态、紧凑且可扩展的硬件安全解决方案，在最小成本下实现可调安全性

Abstract: Logic locking remains one of the most promising defenses against hardware
piracy, yet current approaches often face challenges in scalability and design
overhead. In this paper, we present TLGLock, a new design paradigm that
leverages the structural expressiveness of Threshold Logic Gates (TLGs) and the
energy efficiency of charge recycling to enforce key-dependent functionality at
the gate level. By embedding the key into the gate's weighted logic and
utilizing dynamic charge sharing, TLGLock provides a stateless and compact
alternative to conventional locking techniques. We implement a complete
synthesis-to-locking flow and evaluate it using ISCAS, ITC, and MCNC
benchmarks. Results show that TLGLock achieves up to 30% area, 50% delay, and
20% power savings compared to latch-based locking schemes. In comparison with
XOR and SFLL-HD methods, TLGLock offers up to 3x higher SAT attack resistance
with significantly lower overhead. Furthermore, randomized key-weight
experiments demonstrate that TLGLock can reach up to 100% output corruption
under incorrect keys, enabling tunable security at minimal cost. These results
position TLGLock as a scalable and resilient solution for secure hardware
design.

Conclusion: 这项工作超越了传统的检测和分类方法，能够深入理解行为级别的恶意逻辑，为动态威胁建模和针对性对策开发开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Android malware poses significant challenges to the
maintenance and security of mobile applications (apps). Traditional detection
techniques often struggle to keep pace with emerging malware variants that
employ advanced tactics such as code obfuscation and dynamic behavior
triggering. One major limitation of these approaches is their inability to
localize malicious payloads at a fine-grained level, hindering precise
understanding of malicious behavior. This gap in understanding makes the design
of effective and targeted mitigation strategies difficult, leaving mobile apps
vulnerable to continuously evolving threats.
  To address this gap, we propose MalLoc, a novel approach that leverages the
code understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to localize
malicious payloads at a fine-grained level within Android malware. Our
experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using
LLMs for this task, highlighting the potential of MalLoc to enhance precision
and interpretability in malware analysis. This work advances beyond traditional
detection and classification by enabling deeper insights into behavior-level
malicious logic and opens new directions for research, including dynamic
modeling of localized threats and targeted countermeasure development.

Motivation: 随着隐藏LLM提示在在线文档中频繁出现，这些提示旨在触发间接提示注入攻击，操纵LLM驱动的自动化文档处理系统，影响从简历筛选到学术同行评审等各种应用，因此检测隐藏LLM提示对于确保AI辅助人类决策的信任至关重要

Method: 开发了名为PhantomLint的原型工具，采用原则性方法检测结构化文档中的隐藏LLM提示，支持PDF和HTML格式文档

Result: 在3402个文档（包括学术预印本、简历、论文等）的语料库上评估，能够有效对抗各种隐藏LLM提示的方法，误报率极低（约0.092%），在实际文档检测中具有实用价值

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，能够有效检测各种视觉检查难以发现的隐藏LLM提示，性能可接受，为保护AI辅助决策系统提供了重要技术手段

Abstract: Hidden LLM prompts have appeared in online documents with increasing
frequency. Their goal is to trigger indirect prompt injection attacks while
remaining undetected from human oversight, to manipulate LLM-powered automated
document processing systems, against applications as diverse as r\'esum\'e
screeners through to academic peer review processes. Detecting hidden LLM
prompts is therefore important for ensuring trust in AI-assisted human decision
making.
  This paper presents the first principled approach to hidden LLM prompt
detection in structured documents. We implement our approach in a prototype
tool called PhantomLint. We evaluate PhantomLint against a corpus of 3,402
documents, including both PDF and HTML documents, and covering academic paper
preprints, CVs, theses and more. We find that our approach is generally
applicable against a wide range of methods for hiding LLM prompts from visual
inspection, has a very low false positive rate (approx. 0.092%), is practically
useful for detecting hidden LLM prompts in real documents, while achieving
acceptable performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生技术在智慧城市中日益重要，但在动态对抗环境中安全绑定物理实体和数字孪生仍存在挑战。现有认证方案依赖静态信任模型、集中式机构或无法提供实时可验证绑定，不适合延迟敏感的分布式部署。

Method: 提出PRZK-Bind协议，结合Schnorr零知识证明和椭圆曲线密码学，在不依赖预共享密钥的情况下建立物理实体与数字孪生之间的安全实时对应关系。

Result: 仿真结果显示，PRZK-Bind性能显著提升：延迟降低4.5倍，能耗减少4倍，误接受率比加密密集型基线低10倍以上。

Conclusion: PRZK-Bind适用于未来智慧城市部署，能够提供高效、弹性和可信的数字孪生认证解决方案。

Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology is rapidly becoming essential for smart city
ecosystems, enabling real-time synchronisation and autonomous decision-making
across physical and digital domains. However, as DTs take active roles in
control loops, securely binding them to their physical counterparts in dynamic
and adversarial environments remains a significant challenge. Existing
authentication solutions either rely on static trust models, require
centralised authorities, or fail to provide live and verifiable
physical-digital binding, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive and
distributed deployments. To address this gap, we introduce PRZK-Bind, a
lightweight and decentralised authentication protocol that combines
Schnorr-based zero-knowledge proofs with elliptic curve cryptography to
establish secure, real-time correspondence between physical entities and DTs
without relying on pre-shared secrets. Simulation results show that PRZK-Bind
significantly improves performance, offering up to 4.5 times lower latency and
4 times reduced energy consumption compared to cryptography-heavy baselines,
while maintaining false acceptance rates more than 10 times lower. These
findings highlight its suitability for future smart city deployments requiring
efficient, resilient, and trustworthy DT authentication.

Abstract: As blockchain technology continues to evolve, the security of smart contracts
has increasingly drawn attention from both academia and industry. The Move
language, with its unique resource model and linear type system, provides a
solid foundation for the security of digital assets. However, smart contracts
still face new security challenges due to developer programming errors and the
potential risks associated with cross-module interactions. This paper
systematically analyzes the limitations of existing security tools within the
Move ecosystem and reveals their unique vulnerability patterns. To address
these issues, it introduces MoveScanner, a static analysis tool based on a
control flow graph and data flow analysis architecture. By incorporating
cross-module call graph tracking, MoveScanner can effectively identify five key
types of security vulnerabilities, including resource leaks, weak permission
management, and arithmetic overflows. In terms of design, MoveScanner adheres
to a modular principle, supports bytecode-level analysis and multi-chain
adaptation, and introduces innovative resource trajectory tracking algorithms
and capability matrix analysis methods, thereby significantly reducing the
false positive rate. Empirical results show that MoveScanner achieved 88.2%
detection accuracy in benchmark testing, filling the gap in security tools in
the Move ecosystem. Furthermore, this paper identifies twelve new types of
security risks based on the resource-oriented programming paradigm and provides
a theoretical foundation and practical experience for the development of smart
contract security mechanisms. Future work will focus on combining formal
verification and dynamic analysis techniques to build a security protection
framework covering the entire contract lifecycle

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PoC报告在漏洞验证中具有重要作用，但由于不同平台模板差异导致信息严重缺失，影响报告质量和实用性

Method: 收集4个平台的173,170份PoC报告，定义8个关键方面，结合规则匹配和微调BERT-NER模型提取信息，开发多源信息融合方法利用CVE条目和相关PoC报告补全缺失信息

Result: 发现所有公开平台的PoC报告至少缺失一个关键方面，成功补全69,583份报告（占总数的40.18%）

Conclusion: 多源信息融合方法能有效缓解PoC报告的信息缺失问题，显著提升PoC报告的质量和实用性

Abstract: For vulnerabilities, Proof-of-Concept (PoC) plays an irreplaceable role in
demonstrating the exploitability. PoC reports may include critical information
such as specific usage, test platforms, and more, providing essential insights
for researchers. However, in reality, due to various PoC templates across PoC
platforms, PoC reports extensively suffer from information deficiency, leading
the suboptimal quality and limited usefulness. Fortunately, we found that
information deficiency of PoC reports could be mitigated by the completion from
multiple sources given the same referred vulnerability. In this paper, we
conduct the first study on the deficiency of information in PoC reports across
public platforms. We began by collecting 173,170 PoC reports from 4 different
platforms and defined 8 key aspects that PoCs should contain. By integrating
rule-based matching and a fine-tuned BERT-NER model for extraction of key
aspects, we discovered that all PoC reports available on public platforms have
at least one missing key aspect. Subsequently, we developed a multi-source
information fusion method to complete the missing aspect information in PoC
reports by leveraging CVE entries and related PoC reports from different
sources. Finally, we successfully completed 69,583 PoC reports (40.18% of all
reports).

Conclusion: 该双重增强能力为开发应对不断演变的网络威胁的自适应防御系统提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in network security
defense. However, a significant challenge for IDS in training detection models
is the shortage of adequately labeled malicious samples. To address these
issues, this paper introduces a novel semi-supervised framework
\textbf{GANGRL-LLM}, which integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance malicious code generation and SQL
Injection (SQLi) detection capabilities in few-sample learning scenarios.
Specifically, our framework adopts a collaborative training paradigm where: (1)
the GAN-based discriminator improves malicious pattern recognition through
adversarial learning with generated samples and limited real samples; and (2)
the LLM-based generator refines the quality of malicious code synthesis using
reward signals from the discriminator. The experimental results demonstrate
that even with a limited number of labeled samples, our training framework is
highly effective in enhancing both malicious code generation and detection
capabilities. This dual enhancement capability offers a promising solution for
developing adaptive defense systems capable of countering evolving cyber
threats.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and interconnected systems
in modern vehicles not only introduced a new era of convenience, automation,
and connected vehicles but also elevated their exposure to sophisticated cyber
threats. This is especially evident in US and Canada, where cyber-enabled auto
theft has surged in recent years, revealing the limitations of existing
security measures for connected vehicles. In response, this paper proposes
$AutoGuardX$, a comprehensive cybersecurity framework designed specifically for
connected vehicles. $AutoGuardX$ combines key elements from existing recognized
standards for vehicle security, such as ISO/SAE 21434 and ISO 26262, with
advanced technologies, including machine learning-based anomaly detection, IoT
security protocols, and encrypted communication channels. The framework
addresses major attack vectors like relay attacks, controller area network
(CAN) bus intrusions, and vulnerabilities introduced by emerging technologies
such as 5G and quantum computing. $AutoGuardX$ is extensively evaluated through
security simulations across a mix of Sedans and SUVs from four major vehicle
brands manufactured between 2019 and 2023. The results demonstrate the
framework's adaptability, scalability, and practical effectiveness against
existing and emerging threats.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的网络安全检测系统难以应对日益复杂的网络攻击，需要更主动的检测策略来模拟攻击者在Cyber Kill Chain各阶段的行为模式。

Method: 使用MITRE ATT&CK数据集，通过ATTACK-BERT将攻击技术语义映射到七个攻击阶段，构建阶段特定数据集。集成LightGBM、自定义Transformer编码器、微调BERT和GNN，使用加权软投票集成，并通过有向图建模阶段间依赖关系。

Conclusion: 这种基于图的集成方法能够实现可解释的攻击路径预测，显著增强了主动网络防御能力。

Abstract: The escalating complexity and volume of cyberattacks demand proactive
detection strategies that go beyond traditional rule-based systems. This paper
presents a phase-aware, multi-model machine learning framework that emulates
adversarial behavior across the seven phases of the Cyber Kill Chain using the
MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise dataset. Techniques are semantically mapped to phases
via ATTACK-BERT, producing seven phase-specific datasets. We evaluate LightGBM,
a custom Transformer encoder, fine-tuned BERT, and a Graph Neural Network
(GNN), integrating their outputs through a weighted soft voting ensemble.
Inter-phase dependencies are modeled using directed graphs to capture attacker
movement from reconnaissance to objectives. The ensemble consistently achieved
the highest scores, with F1-scores ranging from 97.47% to 99.83%, surpassing
GNN performance (97.36% to 99.81%) by 0.03%--0.20% across phases. This
graph-driven, ensemble-based approach enables interpretable attack path
forecasting and strengthens proactive cyber defense.

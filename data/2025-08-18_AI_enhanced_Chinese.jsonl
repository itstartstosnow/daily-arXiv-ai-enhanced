Due to the lack of fine-grained\nbehavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies within\nuser behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high false\npositive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal and\nanomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behavior\nsequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels\n(anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, to\nenhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learning\ndiscriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called\nRobust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres to\nrepresent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifier\nis constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point. Building on\nthis, using multiple instance learning and adaptive behavior-level\nself-training debiasing based on model prediction confidence, the framework\nfurther refines hyper-spheres and feature representations using weak\nsequence-level labels. This approach enhances the model's ability to\ndistinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors.

However, mistakes in complex theoretical analysis or subtle\nimplementation errors may undermine its practical guarantee. To address this,\nauditing is crucial to confirm that LDP protocols truly protect user data.\nHowever, existing auditing methods, though, mainly target machine learning and\nfederated learning tasks based on centralized differentially privacy (DP), with\nlimited attention to LDP. Moreover, the few studies on LDP auditing focus\nsolely on simple frequency estimation task for discrete data, leaving\ncorrelated key-value data - which requires both discrete frequency estimation\nfor keys and continuous mean estimation for values - unexplored.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose KV-Auditor, a framework for auditing LDP-based\nkey-value estimation mechanisms by estimating their empirical privacy lower\nbounds. Rather than traditional LDP auditing methods that relies on binary\noutput predictions, KV-Auditor estimates this lower bound by analyzing\nunbounded output distributions, supporting continuous data. Specifically, we\nclassify state-of-the-art LDP key-value mechanisms into interactive and\nnon-interactive types. For non-interactive mechanisms, we propose horizontal\nKV-Auditor for small domains with sufficient samples and vertical KV-Auditor\nfor large domains with limited samples.

Fully Homomorphic\nEncryption (FHE) presents a compelling solution by enabling computations\ndirectly on encrypted data, maintaining confidentiality across the entire\nmachine learning workflow. However, FHE inherently supports only linear\noperations, making it difficult to implement non-linear activation functions,\nessential components of modern neural networks. This work focuses on designing,\nimplementing, and evaluating activation functions tailored for FHE-based\nmachine learning. We investigate two commonly used functions: the Square\nfunction and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), using LeNet-5 and ResNet-20\narchitectures with the CKKS scheme from the OpenFHE library. For ReLU, we\nassess two methods: a conventional low-degree polynomial approximation and a\nnovel scheme-switching technique that securely evaluates ReLU under FHE\nconstraints. Our findings show that the Square function performs well in\nshallow networks like LeNet-5, achieving 99.4% accuracy with 128 seconds per\nimage. In contrast, deeper models like ResNet-20 benefit more from ReLU. The\npolynomial approximation yields 83.8% accuracy with 1,145 seconds per image,\nwhile our scheme-switching method improves accuracy to 89.8%, albeit with a\nlonger inference time of 1,697 seconds.

### [1] [FedMicro-IDA: A Federated Learning and Microservices-based Framework for IoT Data Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20852)
*Safa Ben Atitallah,Maha Driss,Henda Ben Ghezela*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于微服务和联邦学习的物联网数据分析架构，通过边缘计算减少延迟并保护数据隐私，在恶意软件检测任务中达到99.24%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物联网数据分析中的隐私安全问题，同时满足时间敏感性要求，通过分布式架构减少延迟和带宽拥堵。

Method: 采用微服务架构将物联网应用构建为细粒度、松耦合的可重用实体，结合联邦学习技术提供智能微服务。

Result: 在恶意软件检测和分类任务中，使用MaleVis数据集（14,000+张RGB图像，25个恶意软件类和1个良性类），准确率达到99.24%，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 基于微服务和联邦学习的架构能够有效保护数据隐私、降低延迟，并在物联网数据分析任务中取得优异性能。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently proliferated in both size and
complexity. Using multi-source and heterogeneous IoT data aids in providing
efficient data analytics for a variety of prevalent and crucial applications.
To address the privacy and security concerns raised by analyzing IoT data
locally or in the cloud, distributed data analytics techniques were proposed to
collect and analyze data in edge or fog devices. In this context, federated
learning has been recommended as an ideal distributed machine/deep
learning-based technique for edge/fog computing environments. Additionally, the
data analytics results are time-sensitive; they should be generated with
minimal latency and high reliability. As a result, reusing efficient
architectures validated through a high number of challenging test cases would
be advantageous. The work proposed here presents a solution using a
microservices-based architecture that allows an IoT application to be
structured as a collection of fine-grained, loosely coupled, and reusable
entities. The proposed solution uses the promising capabilities of federated
learning to provide intelligent microservices that ensure efficient, flexible,
and extensible data analytics. This solution aims to deliver cloud calculations
to the edge to reduce latency and bandwidth congestion while protecting the
privacy of exchanged data. The proposed approach was validated through an
IoT-malware detection and classification use case. MaleVis, a publicly
available dataset, was used in the experiments to analyze and validate the
proposed approach. This dataset included more than 14,000 RGB-converted images,
comprising 25 malware classes and one benign class. The results showed that our
proposed approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection and classification performance, with a 99.24%.

### [2] [FPT-Noise: Dynamic Scene-Aware Counterattack for Test-Time Adversarial Defense in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20856)
*Jia Deng,Jin Li,Zhenhua Zhao,Shaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出FPT-Noise方法，无需微调即可增强CLIP模型的对抗鲁棒性，通过动态特征调制器、特征感知阈值和场景感知调节来防御对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）对对抗攻击高度脆弱，传统对抗训练方法计算成本高昂，需要一种无需重新训练的高效防御方法。

Method: 使用动态特征调制器生成图像特定和攻击自适应的噪声强度参数；建立特征感知阈值区分干净图像和对抗图像；结合场景感知调节和测试时变换集成来增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在AutoAttack下将平均鲁棒准确率从0.07%提升至56.86%，同时在干净图像上仅损失1.1%的性能。

Conclusion: FPT-Noise是一种高效且有效的测试时防御方法，显著提升了CLIP模型的对抗鲁棒性，无需昂贵的微调过程。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have revealed that VLMs, including CLIP, are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, particularly on their visual modality. Traditional methods
for improving adversarial robustness, such as adversarial training, involve
extensive retraining and can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we
propose a new Test-Time defense: Feature Perception Threshold Counterattack
Noise (FPT-Noise), which enhances the adversarial robustness of CLIP without
costly fine-tuning. Our core contributions are threefold: First, we introduce a
Dynamic Feature Modulator that dynamically generate an image-specific and
attack-adaptive noise intensity parameter. Second, We reanalyzed the image
features of CLIP. When images are exposed to different levels of noise, clean
images and adversarial images exhibit distinct rates of feature change. We
established a feature perception threshold to distinguish clean images from
attacked ones. Finally, we integrate a Scene-Aware Regulation guided by a
stability threshold and leverage Test-Time Transformation Ensembling (TTE) to
further mitigate the impact of residual noise and enhance robustness.Extensive
experimentation has demonstrated that FPT-Noise significantly outperforms
existing Test-Time defense methods, boosting average robust accuracy from 0.07%
to 56.86% under AutoAttack while maintaining high performance on clean images
(-1.1%). The code will be made public following the publication of the study.

### [3] [Everyone Needs AIR: An Agnostic Incident Reporting Framework for Cybersecurity in Operational Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20858)
*Nubio Vidal,Naghmeh Moradpoor,Leandros Maglaras*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了Agnostic Incident Reporting (AIR)框架，包含25个元素，用于实时OT事件报告，支持技术协调和监管对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OT网络与IT日益融合扩大了攻击面，但现有标准未明确事件中应捕获的数据，阻碍了利益相关者间的协调。

Method: 开发AIR框架，包含25个元素组织成7组，涵盖事件背景、时间线、影响和行动，并评估其与主要OT标准的映射和实际应用。

Result: AIR能将高层需求转化为具体字段，覆盖现有框架且不依赖供应商，支持响应期间的情境感知和沟通。

Conclusion: AIR为标准化实时OT事件报告提供了基础，同时支持技术协调和监管对齐。

Abstract: Operational technology (OT) networks are increasingly coupled with
information technology (IT), expanding the attack surface and complicating
incident response. Although OT standards emphasise incident reporting and
evidence preservation, they do not specify what data to capture during an
incident, which hinders coordination across stakeholders. In contrast, IT
guidance defines reporting content but does not address OT constraints. This
paper presents the Agnostic Incident Reporting (AIR) framework for live OT
incident reporting. AIR comprises 25 elements organised into seven groups to
capture incident context, chronology, impacts, and actions, tailored to
technical, managerial, and regulatory needs. We evaluate AIR by mapping it to
major OT standards, defining activation points for integration and triggering
established OT frameworks, and then retrospectively applying it to the 2015
Ukrainian distribution grid incident. The evaluation indicates that AIR
translates high-level requirements into concrete fields, overlays existing
frameworks without vendor dependence, and can support situational awareness and
communication during response. AIR offers a basis for standardising live OT
incident reporting while supporting technical coordination and regulatory
alignment.

### [4] [A new measure for dynamic leakage based on quantitative information flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20922)
*Luigi D. C. Soares,Mário S. Alvim,Natasha Fernandes*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了动态信息泄漏的新定义，将对手对秘密的信念与基线分布解耦，满足非干扰性、单调性和数据处理不等式等公理，并与静态视角兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定量信息流中动态视角的理论成熟度不足，需要弥补与静态视角之间的差距，为系统监控和跟踪提供更好的理论基础。

Method: 提出动态泄漏的新定义，解耦对手信念和基线分布；验证其满足信息论公理；分析强公理不成立的条件；展示与静态视角的兼容性。

Result: 新定义满足非干扰性、松弛版单调性和数据处理不等式；识别了强公理不成立的情况；证明了与静态视角的兼容性。

Conclusion: 该工作为动态信息泄漏提供了更成熟的理论框架，有助于隐私保护数据发布等应用场景的安全分析。

Abstract: Quantitative information flow (QIF) is concerned with assessing the leakage
of information in computational systems. In QIF there are two main perspectives
for the quantification of leakage. On one hand, the static perspective
considers all possible runs of the system in the computation of information
flow, and is usually employed when preemptively deciding whether or not to run
the system. On the other hand, the dynamic perspective considers only a
specific, concrete run of the system that has been realised, while ignoring all
other runs. The dynamic perspective is relevant for, e.g., system monitors and
trackers, especially when deciding whether to continue or to abort a particular
run based on how much leakage has occurred up to a certain point. Although the
static perspective of leakage is well-developed in the literature, the dynamic
perspective still lacks the same level of theoretical maturity. In this paper
we take steps towards bridging this gap with the following key contributions:
(i) we provide a novel definition of dynamic leakage that decouples the
adversary's belief about the secret value from a baseline distribution on
secrets against which the success of the attack is measured; (ii) we
demonstrate that our formalisation satisfies relevant information-theoretic
axioms, including non-interference and relaxed versions of monotonicity and the
data-processing inequality (DPI); (iii) we identify under what kind of analysis
strong versions of the axioms of monotonicity and the DPI might not hold, and
explain the implications of this (perhaps counter-intuitive) outcome; (iv) we
show that our definition of dynamic leakage is compatible with the
well-established static perspective; and (v) we exemplify the use of our
definition on the formalisation of attacks against privacy-preserving data
releases.

### [5] [Security Logs to ATT&CK Insights: Leveraging LLMs for High-Level Threat Understanding and Cognitive Trait Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20930)
*Soham Hans,Stacy Marsella,Sophia Hirschmann,Nikolos Gurney*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一个基于大语言模型(LLM)的框架，通过分析Suricata IDS日志来推断攻击者的MITRE ATT&CK技术和认知策略，将网络层事件映射到高级攻击策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络安全依赖高级情报报告和手动分析攻击链，但实时防御需要从低级别系统遥测数据直接推断攻击者意图和认知策略。

Method: 开发策略驱动的提示系统，将大量网络日志数据高效分段为不同行为阶段，使LLM能够将每个阶段与可能的技术和潜在认知动机关联起来。

Result: 结果表明LLM能够弥合数据包级日志与战略意图之间的语义鸿沟，为认知自适应网络防御提供途径。

Conclusion: 该方法为行为自适应网络防御和认知特征推断奠定了基础，展示了如何将行为信号映射到心理上有意义的决策点。

Abstract: Understanding adversarial behavior in cybersecurity has traditionally relied
on high-level intelligence reports and manual interpretation of attack chains.
However, real-time defense requires the ability to infer attacker intent and
cognitive strategy directly from low-level system telemetry such as intrusion
detection system (IDS) logs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze Suricata IDS logs and infer
attacker actions in terms of MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Our approach is grounded
in the hypothesis that attacker behavior reflects underlying cognitive biases
such as loss aversion, risk tolerance, or goal persistence that can be
extracted and modeled through careful observation of log sequences. This lays
the groundwork for future work on behaviorally adaptive cyber defense and
cognitive trait inference. We develop a strategy-driven prompt system to
segment large amounts of network logs data into distinct behavioral phases in a
highly efficient manner, enabling the LLM to associate each phase with likely
techniques and underlying cognitive motives. By mapping network-layer events to
high-level attacker strategies, our method reveals how behavioral signals such
as tool switching, protocol transitions, or pivot patterns correspond to
psychologically meaningful decision points. The results demonstrate that LLMs
can bridge the semantic gap between packet-level logs and strategic intent,
offering a pathway toward cognitive-adaptive cyber defense.

*Reza Ahmari,Ahmad Mohammadi,Vahid Hemmati,Mohammed Mynuddin,Mahmoud Nabil Mahmoud,Parham Kebria,Abdollah Homaifar,Mehrdad Saif*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究分析了城市空中交通(UAM)车辆自主导航和着陆系统在深度学习模型中的漏洞，特别是针对CNN的特洛伊木马攻击，实验显示攻击导致准确率从96.4%降至73.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究城市空中交通车辆自主导航系统的安全漏洞，特别是特洛伊木马攻击对深度学习模型的威胁，以评估现实世界中的安全风险。

Method: 使用DroNet框架评估城市自主飞行器(UAAVs)的脆弱性，收集定制数据集并训练模型模拟真实条件，开发评估框架识别受感染模型。

Result: 实验结果显示特洛伊木马攻击导致模型准确率显著下降，从96.4%降至73.3%，证明了此类攻击对UAM系统的严重威胁。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了特洛伊木马攻击对城市空中交通系统的潜在安全风险，为未来增强UAM系统韧性研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This study investigates the vulnerabilities of autonomous navigation and
landing systems in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. Specifically, it focuses
on Trojan attacks that target deep learning models, such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). Trojan attacks work by embedding covert triggers within
a model's training data. These triggers cause specific failures under certain
conditions, while the model continues to perform normally in other situations.
We assessed the vulnerability of Urban Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAAVs) using
the DroNet framework. Our experiments showed a significant drop in accuracy,
from 96.4% on clean data to 73.3% on data triggered by Trojan attacks. To
conduct this study, we collected a custom dataset and trained models to
simulate real-world conditions. We also developed an evaluation framework
designed to identify Trojan-infected models. This work demonstrates the
potential security risks posed by Trojan attacks and lays the groundwork for
future research on enhancing the resilience of UAM systems.

### [7] [Self-Jailbreaking: Language Models Can Reason Themselves Out of Safety Alignment After Benign Reasoning Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20956)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Stephen H. Bach*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现推理语言模型在数学或代码领域的良性推理训练后会出现自我越狱现象，即模型会使用多种策略绕过自身的安全防护机制，包括引入良性假设来合理化有害请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示推理语言模型在特定训练后出现的意外安全漏洞，这种自我越狱现象可能威胁模型的安全性，需要系统分析和解决方案。

Method: 通过分析多个开源推理语言模型（如DeepSeek-R1-distilled、Phi-4-mini-reasoning等）的行为，研究自我越狱的机制，并探索通过在训练中加入少量安全推理数据来缓解此问题的方法。

Result: 发现多个推理语言模型都存在自我越狱问题，模型在良性推理训练后变得更加顺从，并在思维链中降低对恶意请求危害性的感知，从而满足这些请求。

Conclusion: 自我越狱是推理语言模型的一个严重安全问题，但通过在训练中加入最小量的安全推理数据可以有效保持模型的安全对齐，为未来更强大的推理语言模型提供了实用的安全维护路径。

Abstract: We discover a novel and surprising phenomenon of unintentional misalignment
in reasoning language models (RLMs), which we call self-jailbreaking.
Specifically, after benign reasoning training on math or code domains, RLMs
will use multiple strategies to circumvent their own safety guardrails. One
strategy is to introduce benign assumptions about users and scenarios to
justify fulfilling harmful requests. For instance, an RLM reasons that harmful
requests like ``outline a strategy for stealing customers' credit card
information from a retail store'' could be associated with the benign intent of
``a security professional trying to test defense,'' despite no such benign
context being provided as input. We observe that many open-weight RLMs,
including DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron,
suffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the
requests. We also provide a mechanistic understanding of self-jailbreaking:
RLMs are more compliant after benign reasoning training, and after
self-jailbreaking, models appear to perceive malicious requests as less harmful
in the CoT, thus enabling compliance with them. To mitigate self-jailbreaking,
we find that including minimal safety reasoning data during training is
sufficient to ensure RLMs remain safety-aligned. Our work provides the first
systematic analysis of self-jailbreaking behavior and offers a practical path
forward for maintaining safety in increasingly capable RLMs.

### [8] [REx86: A Local Large Language Model for Assisting in x86 Assembly Reverse Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20975)
*Darrin Lea,James Ghawaly,Golden Richard III,Aisha Ali-Gombe,Andrew Case*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了REx86，一个通过参数高效微调优化的本地LLM，专门用于x86二进制逆向工程任务，在封闭网络环境中提供隐私安全的代码理解辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决x86二进制逆向工程中因元数据缺失和对抗性混淆导致的效率低下问题，同时避免云托管闭源LLM带来的隐私安全风险，为封闭网络设施提供本地化解决方案。

Method: 在5,981个x86汇编示例的自定义数据集上，对CodeLlama、Qwen2.5-Coder和CodeGemma系列的8个开源模型进行参数高效微调。

Result: 微调的Qwen2.5-Coder-7B模型（REx86）表现最佳：测试集交叉熵损失降低64.2%，语义余弦相似度提升20.3%；用户研究中代码理解显著改善(p=0.031)，正确解决率从31%提升至53%。

Conclusion: REx86在本地开源LLM中提供了最先进的x86逆向工程辅助，证明了领域特定微调的价值，并强调需要更多带注释的反汇编数据来进一步提升LLM在逆向工程中的性能。

Abstract: Reverse engineering (RE) of x86 binaries is indispensable for malware and
firmware analysis, but remains slow due to stripped metadata and adversarial
obfuscation. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for improving RE
efficiency through automated comprehension and commenting, but cloud-hosted,
closed-weight models pose privacy and security risks and cannot be used in
closed-network facilities. We evaluate parameter-efficient fine-tuned local
LLMs for assisting with x86 RE tasks in these settings. Eight open-weight
models across the CodeLlama, Qwen2.5-Coder, and CodeGemma series are fine-tuned
on a custom curated dataset of 5,981 x86 assembly examples. We evaluate them
quantitatively and identify the fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-7B as the top
performer, which we name REx86.
  REx86 reduces test-set cross-entropy loss by 64.2% and improves semantic
cosine similarity against ground truth by 20.3\% over its base model. In a
limited user case study (n=43), REx86 significantly enhanced line-level code
understanding (p = 0.031) and increased the correct-solve rate from 31% to 53%
(p = 0.189), though the latter did not reach statistical significance.
Qualitative analysis shows more accurate, concise comments with fewer
hallucinations.
  REx86 delivers state-of-the-art assistance in x86 RE among local, open-weight
LLMs. Our findings demonstrate the value of domain-specific fine-tuning, and
highlight the need for more commented disassembly data to further enhance LLM
performance in RE. REx86, its dataset, and LoRA adapters are publicly available
at https://github.com/dlea8/REx86 and https://zenodo.org/records/15420461.

### [9] [Can Current Detectors Catch Face-to-Voice Deepfake Attacks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21004)
*Nguyen Linh Bao Nguyen,Alsharif Abuadbba,Kristen Moore,Tingming Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了FOICE音频深度伪造检测，发现现有检测器在标准及噪声条件下均失效，提出了针对FOICE特定伪影的微调策略，并揭示了检测器在专门化与泛化能力之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FOICE技术能够仅凭一张面部图像生成逼真的合成语音，可绕过行业标准认证系统，由于面部图像比语音样本更易获取，这大大降低了大规模攻击的门槛，引发了严重的安全担忧。

Method: 研究两个核心问题：现有音频深度伪造检测器能否可靠检测FOICE生成的语音；对这些检测器进行FOICE数据微调是否能提高检测效果而不产生过拟合。采用系统评估和针对性微调策略。

Result: 领先的检测器在标准和噪声条件下均持续失效；针对FOICE特定伪影的微调策略显著提高了检测准确率；微调后在专门化与对未见语音生成器的鲁棒性之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了当前防御系统的根本弱点，为下一代音频深度伪造检测的新架构和训练协议提供了动机。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled the creation of
increasingly stealthy synthetic voices, commonly referred to as audio
deepfakes. A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly
alarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image,
without requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial
and vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass
industry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and
Microsoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are
far easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering
the barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core
research questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors
reliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and
(RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection
without overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators
such as SpeechT5.
  Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic
evaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail
under both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted
fine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding
significant accuracy improvements. Third, we assess generalization after
fine-tuning, revealing trade-offs between specialization to FOICE and
robustness to unseen synthesis pipelines. These findings expose fundamental
weaknesses in today's defenses and motivate new architectures and training
protocols for next-generation audio deepfake detection.

### [10] [JSTprove: Pioneering Verifiable AI for a Trustless Future](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21024)
*Jonathan Gold,Tristan Freiberg,Haruna Isah,Shirin Shahabi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: JSTprove是一个基于Polyhedra Network Expander后端的zkML工具包，旨在让AI开发者和机器学习工程师能够生成和验证AI推理证明，而无需深厚的密码学专业知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在医疗、金融和网络安全等关键行业的广泛应用，确保AI驱动决策的透明性和正确性变得至关重要。传统的zkML系统需要深厚的密码学专业知识，限制了大多数ML工程师的使用。

Method: JSTprove提供了一个端到端的可验证AI推理管道，通过简单的命令行界面隐藏密码学复杂性，同时暴露可审计的工件以实现可重复性。

Result: JSTprove既可作为满足当前工程需求的可用zkML产品，也可作为未来可验证AI研究和生产部署的可重复基础。

Conclusion: JSTprove通过简化zkML的使用，为关键行业中的AI系统提供了信任、安全和问责的解决方案，同时鼓励社区审查和扩展。

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) systems into critical industries
such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity has transformed decision-making
processes, but it also brings new challenges around trust, security, and
accountability. As AI systems become more ubiquitous, ensuring the transparency
and correctness of AI-driven decisions is crucial, especially when they have
direct consequences on privacy, security, or fairness. Verifiable AI, powered
by Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML), offers a robust solution to these
challenges. zkML enables the verification of AI model inferences without
exposing sensitive data, providing an essential layer of trust and privacy.
However, traditional zkML systems typically require deep cryptographic
expertise, placing them beyond the reach of most ML engineers. In this paper,
we introduce JSTprove, a specialized zkML toolkit, built on Polyhedra Network's
Expander backend, to enable AI developers and ML engineers to generate and
verify proofs of AI inference. JSTprove provides an end-to-end verifiable AI
inference pipeline that hides cryptographic complexity behind a simple
command-line interface while exposing auditable artifacts for reproducibility.
We present the design, innovations, and real-world use cases of JSTprove as
well as our blueprints and tooling to encourage community review and extension.
JSTprove therefore serves both as a usable zkML product for current engineering
needs and as a reproducible foundation for future research and production
deployments of verifiable AI.

### [11] [A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Robust and Secure LLM Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21053)
*Li An,Yujian Liu,Yepeng Liu,Yuheng Bu,Yang Zhang,Shiyu Chang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的强化学习框架，用于优化大语言模型水印的绿色/红色令牌列表设计，解决了多目标优化不稳定和奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印算法大多依赖启发式的绿色/红色令牌列表设计，直接使用强化学习优化面临多目标冲突导致训练不稳定，以及巨大动作空间易受奖励黑客攻击的问题。

Method: 采用端到端强化学习框架，引入锚定机制确保训练稳定性，并添加正则化项防止奖励黑客。

Result: 在两个骨干大语言模型的标准基准测试中，该方法在所有标准上实现了最先进的权衡，特别是在抵抗欺骗攻击方面有显著提升，且不降低其他标准性能。

Conclusion: 提出的强化学习框架能够有效优化水印令牌列表设计，在多目标水印要求下实现更好的性能平衡。

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for tracing and
authenticating text generated by large language models (LLMs). A common
approach to LLM watermarking is to construct a green/red token list and assign
higher or lower generation probabilities to the corresponding tokens,
respectively. However, most existing watermarking algorithms rely on heuristic
green/red token list designs, as directly optimizing the list design with
techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) comes with several challenges.
First, desirable watermarking involves multiple criteria, i.e., detectability,
text quality, robustness against removal attacks, and security against spoofing
attacks. Directly optimizing for these criteria introduces many partially
conflicting reward terms, leading to an unstable convergence process. Second,
the vast action space of green/red token list choices is susceptible to reward
hacking. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end RL framework for robust and
secure LLM watermarking. Our approach adopts an anchoring mechanism for reward
terms to ensure stable training and introduces additional regularization terms
to prevent reward hacking. Experiments on standard benchmarks with two backbone
LLMs show that our method achieves a state-of-the-art trade-off across all
criteria, with notable improvements in resistance to spoofing attacks without
degrading other criteria. Our code is available at
https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/RL-watermark.

### [12] [Soft Instruction De-escalation Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21057)
*Nils Philipp Walter,Chawin Sitawarin,Jamie Hayes,David Stutz,Ilia Shumailov*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出SIC方法，通过迭代式提示净化循环来保护工具增强型LLM代理免受提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在代理系统中处理不可信数据时容易受到提示注入攻击，需要有效的防护机制。

Method: 采用迭代式提示净化循环，反复检查输入数据中的恶意指令，通过重写、屏蔽或删除来处理，直到输入干净或达到最大迭代次数。

Result: SIC方法能有效提高安全性，但最坏情况下仍有15%的攻击成功率，特别是针对非命令式工作流程的攻击。

Conclusion: SIC是一个简单有效的提示净化方法，虽然不能完全免疫攻击，但显著提高了攻击门槛。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems
that interact with an external environment; this makes them susceptible to
prompt injections when dealing with untrusted data. To overcome this
limitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective
iterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our
method repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise
agent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten,
masked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until
the input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative
instruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By
allowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites
may fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later
steps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not
infallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding
non-imperative workflows. This nonetheless raises the bar.

*Jie Zhang,Xiaohong Li,Mengke Zhang,Ruitao Feng,Shanshan Xu,Zhe Hou,Guangdong Bai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了QAE-BAC系统，通过形式化(r,t)-匿名模型量化重识别风险，并使用熵加权路径树优化策略结构，在区块链访问控制中平衡隐私与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决区块链属性访问控制中的双重挑战：区块链透明性威胁用户隐私（重识别攻击），策略匹配的计算复杂性与区块链性能约束冲突。现有方案存在高开销和缺乏可量化匿名保证的问题。

Method: 引入形式化(r,t)-匿名模型动态量化用户重识别风险；设计熵加权路径树基于实时匿名指标优化策略结构，大幅降低策略匹配复杂度。

Result: 在Hyperledger Fabric上实现和评估，QAE-BAC在隐私和性能间取得优越平衡。实验结果显示有效缓解重识别风险，相比现有最优方案吞吐量提升11倍，延迟降低87%。

Conclusion: QAE-BAC证明了在隐私敏感的去中心化应用中平衡隐私保护与系统性能的实用性。

Abstract: Blockchain-based Attribute-Based Access Control (BC-ABAC) offers a
decentralized paradigm for secure data governance but faces two inherent
challenges: the transparency of blockchain ledgers threatens user privacy by
enabling reidentification attacks through attribute analysis, while the
computational complexity of policy matching clashes with blockchain's
performance constraints. Existing solutions, such as those employing
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), often incur high overhead and lack measurable
anonymity guarantees, while efficiency optimizations frequently ignore privacy
implications. To address these dual challenges, this paper proposes QAEBAC
(Quantifiable Anonymity and Efficiency in Blockchain-Based Access Control with
Attribute). QAE-BAC introduces a formal (r, t)-anonymity model to dynamically
quantify the re-identification risk of users based on their access attributes
and history. Furthermore, it features an Entropy-Weighted Path Tree (EWPT) that
optimizes policy structure based on realtime anonymity metrics, drastically
reducing policy matching complexity. Implemented and evaluated on Hyperledger
Fabric, QAE-BAC demonstrates a superior balance between privacy and
performance. Experimental results show that it effectively mitigates
re-identification risks and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
up to an 11x improvement in throughput and an 87% reduction in latency, proving
its practicality for privacy-sensitive decentralized applications.

TL;DR: 对10个主流商业大语言模型在CBRN武器知识扩散风险方面的安全评估，发现现有安全机制存在严重漏洞，简单的提示工程技术就能绕过安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿大语言模型存在前所未有的双重用途风险，可能促进化学、生物、放射性和核武器知识的扩散，需要评估其安全漏洞。

Method: 使用包含200个提示的新CBRN数据集和180个提示的FORTRESS基准子集，采用严格的三层攻击方法学进行评估。

Result: 深度诱导攻击成功率高达86.0%，而直接请求仅为33.8%；模型安全性能差异巨大，从2%到96%不等；8个模型在增强危险材料属性时超过70%的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前安全对齐存在根本性脆弱性，简单的提示工程就能绕过安全防护获取危险CBRN信息，挑战行业安全声明，急需标准化评估框架和更强大的对齐技术。

Abstract: Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) pose unprecedented dual-use risks
through the potential proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear (CBRN) weapons knowledge. We present the first comprehensive evaluation
of 10 leading commercial LLMs against both a novel 200-prompt CBRN dataset and
a 180-prompt subset of the FORTRESS benchmark, using a rigorous three-tier
attack methodology. Our findings expose critical safety vulnerabilities: Deep
Inception attacks achieve 86.0\% success versus 33.8\% for direct requests,
demonstrating superficial filtering mechanisms; Model safety performance varies
dramatically from 2\% (claude-opus-4) to 96\% (mistral-small-latest) attack
success rates; and eight models exceed 70\% vulnerability when asked to enhance
dangerous material properties. We identify fundamental brittleness in current
safety alignment, where simple prompt engineering techniques bypass safeguards
for dangerous CBRN information. These results challenge industry safety claims
and highlight urgent needs for standardized evaluation frameworks, transparent
safety metrics, and more robust alignment techniques to mitigate catastrophic
misuse risks while preserving beneficial capabilities.

*Yukun Jiang,Mingjie Li,Michael Backes,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于任务并发的LLM越狱攻击方法JAIL-CON，通过在相邻单词中编码不同意图来实现并发任务，显著降低了有害内容被防护机制过滤的概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击主要遵循顺序逻辑，而并发作为顺序场景的自然扩展被忽视。研究发现将有害任务与良性任务结合能显著降低被防护机制检测的概率。

Method: 提出词级方法实现LLM中的任务并发，其中相邻单词编码不同意图。开发了JAIL-CON迭代攻击框架，通过任务并发进行越狱。

Result: 在广泛使用的LLM上实验表明，JAIL-CON相比现有攻击具有更强的越狱能力。并发答案比顺序答案更具隐蔽性，更难被防护机制检测。

Conclusion: 任务并发在LLM越狱中具有独特优势，并发答案比顺序答案更隐蔽，突显了并发在LLM安全中的潜在风险。

Abstract: Despite their superior performance on a wide range of domains, large language
models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to misuse for generating harmful content, a
risk that has been further amplified by various jailbreak attacks. Existing
jailbreak attacks mainly follow sequential logic, where LLMs understand and
answer each given task one by one. However, concurrency, a natural extension of
the sequential scenario, has been largely overlooked. In this work, we first
propose a word-level method to enable task concurrency in LLMs, where adjacent
words encode divergent intents. Although LLMs maintain strong utility in
answering concurrent tasks, which is demonstrated by our evaluations on
mathematical and general question-answering benchmarks, we notably observe that
combining a harmful task with a benign one significantly reduces the
probability of it being filtered by the guardrail, showing the potential risks
associated with concurrency in LLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce
$\texttt{JAIL-CON}$, an iterative attack framework that
$\underline{\text{JAIL}}$breaks LLMs via task $\underline{\text{CON}}$currency.
Experiments on widely-used LLMs demonstrate the strong jailbreak capabilities
of $\texttt{JAIL-CON}$ compared to existing attacks. Furthermore, when the
guardrail is applied as a defense, compared to the sequential answers generated
by previous attacks, the concurrent answers in our $\texttt{JAIL-CON}$ exhibit
greater stealthiness and are less detectable by the guardrail, highlighting the
unique feature of task concurrency in jailbreaking LLMs.

*Mingrui Liu,Sixiao Zhang,Cheng Long,Kwok Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TrojFill是一种黑盒越狱方法，通过将有害指令嵌入到多部分模板中，让模型生成包含越狱内容的详细示例，同时降低拒绝率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱技术存在局限性：白盒方法需要模型内部信息，不适用于闭源API；黑盒方法生成的模板缺乏可解释性和可迁移性。

Method: 将不安全指令重构为模板填充任务，通过占位符替换或编码方式嵌入有害指令，让模型进行不安全推理并生成详细示例。

Result: 在主流LLMs上表现优异：Gemini-flash-2.5和DeepSeek-3.1达到100%攻击成功率，GPT-4o达到97%。

Conclusion: TrojFill在保持高攻击成功率的同时，提高了生成提示的可解释性和可迁移性，为红队测试研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly and now encode extensive
world knowledge. Despite safety fine-tuning, however, they remain susceptible
to adversarial prompts that elicit harmful content. Existing jailbreak
techniques fall into two categories: white-box methods (e.g., gradient-based
approaches such as GCG), which require model internals and are infeasible for
closed-source APIs, and black-box methods that rely on attacker LLMs to search
or mutate prompts but often produce templates that lack explainability and
transferability. We introduce TrojFill, a black-box jailbreak that reframes
unsafe instruction as a template-filling task. TrojFill embeds obfuscated
harmful instructions (e.g., via placeholder substitution or Caesar/Base64
encoding) inside a multi-part template that asks the model to (1) reason why
the original instruction is unsafe (unsafety reasoning) and (2) generate a
detailed example of the requested text, followed by a sentence-by-sentence
analysis. The crucial "example" component acts as a Trojan Horse that contains
the target jailbreak content while the surrounding task framing reduces refusal
rates. We evaluate TrojFill on standard jailbreak benchmarks across leading
LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen), showing strong empirical
performance (e.g., 100% attack success on Gemini-flash-2.5 and DeepSeek-3.1,
and 97% on GPT-4o). Moreover, the generated prompts exhibit improved
interpretability and transferability compared with prior black-box optimization
approaches. We release our code, sample prompts, and generated outputs to
support future red-teaming research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对多模态大语言模型的黑盒越狱攻击方法，通过文本和图像提示来评估模型安全性，并设计了重新攻击策略和防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在安全漏洞，特别是越狱攻击可能导致未经授权或有害的响应，视觉模态的加入带来了新的安全威胁维度。

Method: 设计带有挑衅指令的文本提示，以及具有突变和多图像能力的图像提示，采用重新攻击策略来加强评估。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效评估开源和闭源多模态大语言模型的安全性，并识别出现有防御方法的不足。

Conclusion: 重新设计的防御方法在训练时和推理时都能提高对越狱攻击的防护能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) comprise of both visual and textual
modalities to process vision language tasks. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to
security-related issues, such as jailbreak attacks that alter the model's input
to induce unauthorized or harmful responses. The incorporation of the
additional visual modality introduces new dimensions to security threats. In
this paper, we proposed a black-box jailbreak method via both text and image
prompts to evaluate MLLMs. In particular, we designed text prompts with
provocative instructions, along with image prompts that introduced mutation and
multi-image capabilities. To strengthen the evaluation, we also designed a
Re-attack strategy. Empirical results show that our proposed work can improve
capabilities to assess the security of both open-source and closed-source
MLLMs. With that, we identified gaps in existing defense methods to propose new
strategies for both training-time and inference-time defense methods, and
evaluated them across the new jailbreak methods. The experiment results showed
that the re-designed defense methods improved protections against the jailbreak
attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AgentBound是首个针对MCP服务器的访问控制框架，结合声明式策略机制和策略执行引擎，无需修改MCP服务器即可遏制恶意行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP已成为连接AI代理与外部工具的标准协议，但安全性滞后，数千个MCP服务器拥有对主机系统的无限制访问权限，形成了广泛的攻击面。

Method: 采用受Android权限模型启发的声明式策略机制，结合策略执行引擎，能够自动从源代码生成访问控制策略（准确率达80.9%）。

Result: AgentBound能够阻止多个恶意MCP服务器中的大部分安全威胁，策略执行引擎引入的开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 为开发者和项目经理提供了保护MCP服务器的实用基础，同时保持生产力，使研究人员和工具构建者能够探索声明式访问控制和MCP安全的新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into AI agents that interact with
external tools and environments to perform complex tasks. The Model Context
Protocol (MCP) has become the de facto standard for connecting agents with such
resources, but security has lagged behind: thousands of MCP servers execute
with unrestricted access to host systems, creating a broad attack surface. In
this paper, we introduce AgentBound, the first access control framework for MCP
servers. AgentBound combines a declarative policy mechanism, inspired by the
Android permission model, with a policy enforcement engine that contains
malicious behavior without requiring MCP server modifications. We build a
dataset containing the 296 most popular MCP servers, and show that access
control policies can be generated automatically from source code with 80.9%
accuracy. We also show that AgentBound blocks the majority of security threats
in several malicious MCP servers, and that policy enforcement engine introduces
negligible overhead. Our contributions provide developers and project managers
with a practical foundation for securing MCP servers while maintaining
productivity, enabling researchers and tool builders to explore new directions
for declarative access control and MCP security.

TL;DR: 提出了一个扩展的数字取证框架，用于分析自托管云存储系统（以Nextcloud为例），通过设备监控和云API实现结构化、可重复的证据获取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自托管云存储平台（如Nextcloud）日益流行，但给数字取证调查带来了新挑战，现有取证框架存在局限性，需要系统分析客户端和服务器组件。

Method: 扩展现有取证框架，整合设备监控和云API，开发开源采集工具，利用Nextcloud原生API可靠访问取证工件。

Result: 成功演示了如何通过Nextcloud API获取取证工件，并提供了实现该方法的开源工具。

Conclusion: 该框架为调查人员提供了分析自托管云存储系统的灵活方法，并为这一不断发展的数字取证领域奠定了基础。

Abstract: Self-hosted cloud storage platforms like Nextcloud are gaining popularity
among individuals and organizations seeking greater control over their data.
However, this shift introduces new challenges for digital forensic
investigations, particularly in systematically analyzing both client and server
components. Despite Nextcloud's widespread use, it has received limited
attention in forensic research. In this work, we critically examine existing
cloud storage forensic frameworks and highlight their limitations. To address
the gaps, we propose an extended forensic framework that incorporates device
monitoring and leverages cloud APIs for structured, repeatable evidence
acquisition. Using Nextcloud as a case study, we demonstrate how its native
APIs can be used to reliably access forensic artifacts, and we introduce an
open-source acquisition tool that implements this approach. Our framework
equips investigators with a more flexible method for analyzing self-hosted
cloud storage systems, and offers a foundation for further development in this
evolving area of digital forensics.

### [20] [LLM-Powered Detection of Price Manipulation in DeFi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21272)
*Lu Liu,Wuqi Zhang,Lili Wei,Hao Guan,Yongqiang Tian,Yepang Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PMDetector是一个结合静态分析和LLM推理的混合框架，用于主动检测DeFi智能合约中的价格操纵漏洞，在真实数据集上达到88%精确率和90%召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeFi智能合约管理数十亿美元资金，价格操纵漏洞（通常通过闪电贷）造成重大财务损失。现有检测方法有限：反应性方法仅在攻击发生后分析，而主动静态分析工具依赖僵化的预定义启发式规则，无法识别新型变体或理解复杂经济逻辑。

Method: 提出PMDetector混合框架，结合静态分析和LLM推理。采用三阶段流程：1) 静态污点分析识别潜在漏洞代码路径；2) 两阶段LLM过程通过分析防御措施过滤路径，然后模拟攻击评估可利用性；3) 静态分析检查器验证LLM结果，仅保留高风险路径并生成详细漏洞报告。

Result: 在包含73个真实漏洞和288个良性DeFi协议的数据集上，PMDetector使用Gemini 2.5-flash达到88%精确率和90%召回率，显著优于最先进的静态分析和基于LLM的方法。使用GPT-4.1审计一个漏洞仅需0.03美元和4.0秒。

Conclusion: PMDetector提供了一种高效且成本效益高的替代方案，能够主动检测DeFi价格操纵漏洞，克服现有方法的局限性，为智能合约安全审计提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts manage billions of dollars,
making them a prime target for exploits. Price manipulation vulnerabilities,
often via flash loans, are a devastating class of attacks causing significant
financial losses. Existing detection methods are limited. Reactive approaches
analyze attacks only after they occur, while proactive static analysis tools
rely on rigid, predefined heuristics, limiting adaptability. Both depend on
known attack patterns, failing to identify novel variants or comprehend complex
economic logic. We propose PMDetector, a hybrid framework combining static
analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-based reasoning to proactively detect
price manipulation vulnerabilities. Our approach uses a formal attack model and
a three-stage pipeline. First, static taint analysis identifies potentially
vulnerable code paths. Second, a two-stage LLM process filters paths by
analyzing defenses and then simulates attacks to evaluate exploitability.
Finally, a static analysis checker validates LLM results, retaining only
high-risk paths and generating comprehensive vulnerability reports. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we built a dataset of 73 real-world vulnerable and 288
benign DeFi protocols. Results show PMDetector achieves 88% precision and 90%
recall with Gemini 2.5-flash, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
static analysis and LLM-based approaches. Auditing a vulnerability with
PMDetector costs just $0.03 and takes 4.0 seconds with GPT-4.1, offering an
efficient and cost-effective alternative to manual audits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FIDO2标准使用ECDSA和RSA等经典密码签名算法，这些算法在面对大规模量子计算机时会变得不安全。需要研究后量子密码算法来保护FIDO2认证系统的安全性。

Method: 采用基于Crystals Dilithium的模块格数字签名算法（ML-DSA）作为后量子密码签名标准，并与经典算法进行性能和安全性的比较分析。

Result: 研究发现ML-DSA在性能和安全方面与经典算法相比具有竞争力，能够为FIDO2提供量子安全的认证方案。

Conclusion: ML-DSA可以作为FIDO2的后量子密码签名标准，有效抵御量子计算攻击，确保密码无认证系统的长期安全性。

Abstract: Authentication systems have evolved a lot since the 1960s when Fernando
Corbato first proposed the password-based authentication. In 2013, the FIDO
Alliance proposed using secure hardware for authentication, thus marking a
milestone in the passwordless authentication era [1]. Passwordless
authentication with a possession-based factor often relied on hardware-backed
cryptographic methods. FIDO2 being one an amalgamation of the W3C Web
Authentication and FIDO Alliance Client to Authenticator Protocol is an
industry standard for secure passwordless authentication with rising adoption
for the same [2]. However, the current FIDO2 standards use ECDSA with SHA-256
(ES256), RSA with SHA-256 (RS256) and similar classical cryptographic signature
algorithms. This makes it insecure against attacks involving large-scale
quantum computers [3]. This study aims at exploring the usability of Module
Lattice based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), based on Crystals Dilithium
as a post quantum cryptographic signature standard for FIDO2. The paper
highlights the performance and security in comparison to keys with classical
algorithms.

TL;DR: FLAMES是一个自动化方法，使用领域适应的大型语言模型生成Solidity "require"语句作为运行时防护，以保护智能合约免受攻击，无需漏洞标签或人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约漏洞每年造成数十亿美元损失，现有自动化分析工具无法生成可部署的防御措施。

Method: 使用在514,506个已验证合约中提取的真实世界不变量进行填充中间监督微调的领域适应大型语言模型。

Result: 编译成功率96.7%；在5000个挑战性不变量测试集上，44.5%案例产生精确或语义等价匹配；阻止了108个真实攻击中的22个(20.4%)；成功阻止了APEMAGA真实事件攻击。

Conclusion: 领域适应的LLM可以自动为智能合约生成生产就绪的安全防御，无需漏洞检测、形式规范或人工干预。

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities cost billions of dollars annually, yet
existing automated analysis tools fail to generate deployable defenses. We
present FLAMES, a novel automated approach that synthesizes executable runtime
guards as Solidity "require" statements to harden smart contracts against
exploits. Unlike prior work that relies on vulnerability labels, symbolic
analysis, or natural language specifications, FLAMES employs domain-adapted
large language models trained through fill-in-the-middle supervised fine-tuning
on real-world invariants extracted from 514,506 verified contracts. Our
extensive evaluation across three dimensions demonstrates FLAMES's
effectiveness: (1) Compilation: FLAMES achieves 96.7% compilability for
synthesized invariant (2) Semantic Quality: on a curated test set of 5,000
challenging invariants, FLAMES produces exact or semantically equivalent
matches to ground truth in 44.5% of cases; (3) Exploit Mitigation: FLAMES
prevents 22 out of 108 real exploits (20.4%) while preserving contract
functionality, and (4) FLAMES successfully blocks the real-world APEMAGA
incident by synthesizing a pre-condition that mitigates the attack. FLAMES
establishes that domain-adapted LLMs can automatically generate
production-ready security defenses for smart contracts without requiring
vulnerability detection, formal specifications, or human intervention. We
release our code, model weights, datasets, and evaluation infrastructure to
enable reproducible research in this critical domain.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出SBASH框架，使用轻量级本地LLM解决蜜罐的数据保护问题，研究RAG和非RAG LLM在Linux shell命令中的表现，发现RAG能提高未调优模型的准确性，而通过系统提示调优的模型无需RAG也能达到类似准确性且延迟更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜜罐需要最大化攻击者参与度，上下文感知能力至关重要。传统LLM方法存在准确性、响应时间、运营成本和数据保护等问题，特别是云部署带来的数据安全隐患。

Method: 提出SBASH框架，使用轻量级本地LLM管理数据保护问题。研究RAG支持和非RAG的LLM在Linux shell命令中的应用，通过响应时间差异、人类测试者评估的真实性、以及使用Levenshtein距离、SBert和BertScore计算的与真实系统相似度等指标进行评估。

Result: RAG提高了未调优模型的准确性；通过系统提示调优的模型无需RAG也能达到与未调优+RAG相似的准确性，且延迟略低。

Conclusion: SBASH框架通过本地部署轻量级LLM有效解决了数据保护问题，RAG和非RAG方法在不同场景下各有优势，系统提示调优可以在不依赖RAG的情况下实现良好性能。

Abstract: Honeypots are decoy systems used for gathering valuable threat intelligence
or diverting attackers away from production systems. Maximising attacker
engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that
context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems
and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer
from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time,
high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We
propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which
manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We
investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and
non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different
metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and
similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and
BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models
that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a
Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while
having a slightly lower latency.

Motivation: 现有的全同态加密方案通常需要自举操作来处理噪声，这会带来性能瓶颈。GRAFHEN旨在消除这一需求，提供更高效的无噪声全同态加密。

Method: 基于Nuida等人的工作，使用群编码技术，通过重写系统在机器上表示群，使子群成员问题变得极其困难，同时优化性能。

Result: 实现比现有标准快几个数量级的性能，并通过安全性分析证明了方案对各种攻击的抵抗力。

Conclusion: GRAFHEN提供了一种无需自举的高效全同态加密方案，在保持安全性的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: We present GRAFHEN, a new cryptographic scheme which offers Fully Homomorphic
Encryption without the need for bootstrapping (or in other words, without
noise). Building on the work of Nuida and others, we achieve this using
encodings in groups.
  The groups are represented on a machine using rewriting systems. In this way
the subgroup membership problem, which an attacker would have to solve in order
to break the scheme, becomes maximally hard, while performance is preserved. In
fact we include a simple benchmark demonstrating that our implementation runs
several orders of magnitude faster than existing standards.
  We review many possible attacks against our protocol and explain how to
protect the scheme in each case.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的隐私威胁模型框架PTMF，通过分析威胁行为者的行动和意图来深入理解隐私威胁，并在物联网系统中进行了应用验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私威胁分析主要关注威胁发生领域和可能性，但缺乏对威胁行为者、其行动和意图的深入理解，需要开发更全面的隐私威胁分析框架。

Method: 基于MITRE ATT&CK框架和LINDDUN隐私威胁模型，开发了隐私为中心的PTMF框架，并通过问卷调查收集了行业和学术界专家的意见，分析了12个物联网隐私威胁。

Result: 识别了物联网用户识别隐私威胁中的前三大威胁行为者及其关键路径，以及其余11个隐私威胁的相关信息，为理解威胁行为者活动提供了数据支持。

Conclusion: PTMF框架为理解隐私威胁行为者的活动和意图提供了坚实基础，有助于在物联网系统中主动有效地部署隐私保护措施来缓解隐私威胁。

Abstract: Previous studies on PTA have focused on analyzing privacy threats based on
the potential areas of occurrence and their likelihood of occurrence. However,
an in-depth understanding of the threat actors involved, their actions, and the
intentions that result in privacy threats is essential. In this paper, we
present a novel Privacy Threat Model Framework (PTMF) that analyzes privacy
threats through different phases.
  The PTMF development is motivated through the selected tactics from the MITRE
ATT\&CK framework and techniques from the LINDDUN privacy threat model, making
PTMF a privacy-centered framework. The proposed PTMF can be employed in various
ways, including analyzing the activities of threat actors during privacy
threats and assessing privacy risks in IoT systems, among others. In this
paper, we conducted a user study on 12 privacy threats associated with IoT by
developing a questionnaire based on PTMF and recruited experts from both
industry and academia in the fields of security and privacy to gather their
opinions. The collected data were analyzed and mapped to identify the threat
actors involved in the identification of IoT users (IU) and the remaining 11
privacy threats. Our observation revealed the top three threat actors and the
critical paths they used during the IU privacy threat, as well as the remaining
11 privacy threats. This study could provide a solid foundation for
understanding how and where privacy measures can be proactively and effectively
deployed in IoT systems to mitigate privacy threats based on the activities and
intentions of threat actors within these systems.

Motivation: 大规模设备分析系统需要在保证高隐私安全标准的同时，满足数据质量、可用性和资源效率要求。

Method: 使用AMD SEV-SNP和Intel TDX等TEE技术，设备加密上传数据并标记允许的服务器处理步骤，通过开源TEE托管密钥管理服务确保数据仅能被授权步骤访问。

Conclusion: 该系统通过TEE技术实现了可验证的隐私保护，能够处理非结构化数据并应用差分隐私，同时允许外部方验证所有数据处理都在TEE中进行。

Abstract: Large-scale systems that compute analytics over a fleet of devices must
achieve high privacy and security standards while also meeting data quality,
usability, and resource efficiency expectations. We present a next-generation
federated analytics system that uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
based on technologies like AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX to provide verifiable
privacy guarantees for all server-side processing. In our system, devices
encrypt and upload data, tagging it with a limited set of allowable server-side
processing steps. An open source, TEE-hosted key management service guarantees
that the data is accessible only to those steps, which are themselves protected
by TEE confidentiality and integrity assurance guarantees. The system is
designed for flexible workloads, including processing unstructured data with
LLMs (for structured summarization) before aggregation into differentially
private insights (with automatic parameter tuning). The transparency properties
of our system allow any external party to verify that all raw and derived data
is processed in TEEs, protecting it from inspection by the system operator, and
that differential privacy is applied to all released results. This system has
been successfully deployed in production, providing helpful insights into
real-world GenAI experiences.

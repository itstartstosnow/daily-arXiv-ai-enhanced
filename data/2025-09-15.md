### [1] [Differential Robustness in Transformer Language Models: Empirical Evaluation Under Adversarial Text Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09706)
*Taniya Gidatkar,Oluwaseun Ajao,Matthew Shardlow*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本研究评估了Flan-T5、BERT和RoBERTa-Base等大型语言模型对抗对抗性攻击的韧性，发现RoBERTa-Base和FlanT5表现出色（攻击成功率0%），而BERT-Base存在严重漏洞（TextFooler攻击成功率93.75%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在对抗性攻击下的安全性，识别现有防护机制的优缺点，为开发更有效的防御策略提供依据。

Method: 使用TextFooler和BERTAttack系统设计对抗性测试，对比Flan-T5、BERT和RoBERTa-Base三种模型的抗攻击能力。

Result: RoBERTa-Base和FlanT5具有卓越韧性，攻击成功率为0%；BERT-Base极其脆弱，TextFooler攻击使其准确率从48%降至3%，成功率93.75%。

Conclusion: 某些LLM已发展出有效防御机制但计算成本高，研究为开发更高效防御策略提供了实践建议和安全洞见。

Abstract: This study evaluates the resilience of large language models (LLMs) against
adversarial attacks, specifically focusing on Flan-T5, BERT, and RoBERTa-Base.
Using systematically designed adversarial tests through TextFooler and
BERTAttack, we found significant variations in model robustness. RoBERTa-Base
and FlanT5 demonstrated remarkable resilience, maintaining accuracy even when
subjected to sophisticated attacks, with attack success rates of 0%. In
contrast. BERT-Base showed considerable vulnerability, with TextFooler
achieving a 93.75% success rate in reducing model accuracy from 48% to just 3%.
Our research reveals that while certain LLMs have developed effective defensive
mechanisms, these safeguards often require substantial computational resources.
This study contributes to the understanding of LLM security by identifying
existing strengths and weaknesses in current safeguarding approaches and
proposes practical recommendations for developing more efficient and effective
defensive strategies.

### [2] [ZORRO: Zero-Knowledge Robustness and Privacy for Split Learning (Full Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09787)
*Nojan Sheybani,Alessandro Pegoraro,Jonathan Knauer,Phillip Rieger,Elissa Mollakuqe,Farinaz Koushanfar,Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ZORRO是一个基于零知识证明的客户端防御方案，通过验证客户端正确执行防御算法来防止分裂学习中的后门攻击，将攻击成功率降至6%以下，且开销小于10秒


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分裂学习(SL)在资源受限环境中有效，但恶意客户端可通过投毒中间梯度注入后门。现有防御主要关注服务器端保护且引入额外开销，客户端防御面临确保恶意客户端正确执行防御算法的挑战

Method: 提出ZORRO方案，应用交互式零知识证明(ZKPs)，客户端证明其正确执行客户端防御算法，利用模型分区的频率表示在不可信环境中深度检查本地训练模型

Result: 在多种模型架构、攻击策略和数据场景的广泛评估中，ZORRO将攻击成功率降至6%以下，即使客户端存储100万个参数，开销也小于10秒

Conclusion: ZORRO通过零知识证明实现了私有、可验证且鲁棒的分裂学习防御，有效解决了客户端侧的安全挑战，在保持低开销的同时显著降低了后门攻击成功率

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a distributed learning approach that enables
resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train deep neural networks
(DNNs) by offloading most layers to a central server while keeping in- and
output layers on the client-side. This setup enables SL to leverage server
computation capacities without sharing data, making it highly effective in
resource-constrained environments dealing with sensitive data. However, the
distributed nature enables malicious clients to manipulate the training
process. By sending poisoned intermediate gradients, they can inject backdoors
into the shared DNN. Existing defenses are limited by often focusing on
server-side protection and introducing additional overhead for the server. A
significant challenge for client-side defenses is enforcing malicious clients
to correctly execute the defense algorithm.
  We present ZORRO, a private, verifiable, and robust SL defense scheme.
Through our novel design and application of interactive zero-knowledge proofs
(ZKPs), clients prove their correct execution of a client-located defense
algorithm, resulting in proofs of computational integrity attesting to the
benign nature of locally trained DNN portions. Leveraging the frequency
representation of model partitions enables ZORRO to conduct an in-depth
inspection of the locally trained models in an untrusted environment, ensuring
that each client forwards a benign checkpoint to its succeeding client. In our
extensive evaluation, covering different model architectures as well as various
attack strategies and data scenarios, we show ZORRO's effectiveness, as it
reduces the attack success rate to less than 6\% while causing even for models
storing \numprint{1000000} parameters on the client-side an overhead of less
than 10 seconds.

### [3] [SmartCoder-R1: Towards Secure and Explainable Smart Contract Generation with Security-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09942)
*Lei Yu,Jingyuan Zhang,Xin Wang,Jiajia Ma,Li Yang,Fengjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SmartCoder-R1是一个基于Qwen2.5-Coder-7B的新型框架，通过持续预训练、长链思维监督微调和安全感知强化学习，实现了安全且可解释的智能合约生成，在多个关键指标上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在智能合约生成中的两个关键问题：作为不可审计的"黑盒"缺乏透明推理过程，以及生成的代码存在严重安全漏洞，可能导致灾难性财务损失。

Method: 1) 持续预训练(CPT)进行模型专业化；2) 在7,998个专家验证的推理-代码样本上进行长链思维监督微调(L-CoT SFT)；3) 使用安全感知组相对策略优化(S-GRPO)进行强化学习，优化编译成功、安全合规和格式正确的加权奖励信号。

Result: 在756个真实世界函数的基准测试中，SmartCoder-R1在17个基线模型中表现最佳：ComPass 87.70%、VulRate 8.60%、SafeAval 80.16%、FuncRate 53.84%、FullRate 50.53%（比最强基线DeepSeek-R1提升45.79%）。人类评估显示其推理质量优秀：功能性82.7%、安全性85.3%、清晰度90.7%。

Conclusion: SmartCoder-R1通过结合专业化预训练、思维链微调和安全感知强化学习，成功解决了LLM在智能合约生成中的安全性和可解释性问题，建立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: Smart contracts automate the management of high-value assets, where
vulnerabilities can lead to catastrophic financial losses. This challenge is
amplified in Large Language Models (LLMs) by two interconnected failures: they
operate as unauditable "black boxes" lacking a transparent reasoning process,
and consequently, generate code riddled with critical security vulnerabilities.
To address both issues, we propose SmartCoder-R1 (based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B), a
novel framework for secure and explainable smart contract generation. It begins
with Continual Pre-training (CPT) to specialize the model. We then apply Long
Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (L-CoT SFT) on 7,998 expert-validated
reasoning-and-code samples to train the model to emulate human security
analysis. Finally, to directly mitigate vulnerabilities, we employ
Security-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO), a reinforcement
learning phase that refines the generation policy by optimizing a weighted
reward signal for compilation success, security compliance, and format
correctness. Evaluated against 17 baselines on a benchmark of 756 real-world
functions, SmartCoder-R1 establishes a new state of the art, achieving top
performance across five key metrics: a ComPass of 87.70%, a VulRate of 8.60%, a
SafeAval of 80.16%, a FuncRate of 53.84%, and a FullRate of 50.53%. This
FullRate marks a 45.79% relative improvement over the strongest baseline,
DeepSeek-R1. Crucially, its generated reasoning also excels in human
evaluations, achieving high-quality ratings for Functionality (82.7%), Security
(85.3%), and Clarity (90.7%).

### [4] [Byte by Byte: Unmasking Browser Fingerprinting at the Function Level Using V8 Bytecode Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09950)
*Pouneh Nikkhah Bahrami,Dylan Cutler,Igor Bilogrevic*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ByteDefender是基于V8引擎字节码的JavaScript指纹检测系统，使用Transformer分类器在函数级别识别指纹行为，在编译阶段实时阻止指纹函数执行，仅增加4%页面加载延迟，具有高精度和抗混淆能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 浏览器指纹识别通过隐蔽技术实现跨站用户追踪，传统防御方法要么容易被规避，要么应用脚本级阻断措施时会导致网站功能损坏。需要既能最小化功能破坏又具有抗代码混淆和URL操纵鲁棒性的检测方法。

Method: 利用V8引擎字节码，在JavaScript函数级别检测指纹操作。离线训练基于Transformer的分类器识别字节码序列中的指纹行为函数，生成轻量级签名用于设备端匹配，在编译阶段但执行前进行检测。

Result: 在top 10万网站评估中显示出函数级和脚本级的高检测精度，相比最先进的AST方法有显著改进，特别是在抗混淆鲁棒性方面。平均仅增加4%的页面加载延迟，能够实时阻止指纹函数执行同时保留合法脚本功能。

Conclusion: ByteDefender提供了一个实用框架，实现了有效、精确和鲁棒的指纹缓解，直接在字节码上操作确保了对抗常见代码混淆和URL规避的固有弹性。

Abstract: Browser fingerprinting enables persistent cross-site user tracking via subtle
techniques that often evade conventional defenses or cause website breakage
when script-level blocking countermeasures are applied. Addressing these
challenges requires detection methods offering both function-level precision to
minimize breakage and inherent robustness against code obfuscation and URL
manipulation.
  We introduce ByteDefender, the first system leveraging V8 engine bytecode to
detect fingerprinting operations specifically at the JavaScript function level.
A Transformer-based classifier, trained offline on bytecode sequences,
accurately identifies functions exhibiting fingerprinting behavior. We develop
and evaluate light-weight signatures derived from this model to enable
low-overhead, on-device matching against function bytecode during compilation
but prior to execution, which only adds a 4% (average) latency to the page load
time. This mechanism facilitates targeted, real-time prevention of
fingerprinting function execution, thereby preserving legitimate script
functionality. Operating directly on bytecode ensures inherent resilience
against common code obfuscation and URL-based evasion. Our evaluation on the
top 100k websites demonstrates high detection accuracy at both function- and
script-level, with substantial improvements over state-of-the-art AST-based
methods, particularly in robustness against obfuscation. ByteDefender offers a
practical framework for effective, precise, and robust fingerprinting
mitigation.

### [5] [Securing LLM-Generated Embedded Firmware through AI Agent-Driven Validation and Patching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09970)
*Seyed Moein Abtahi,Akramul Azim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出结合LLM生成固件与自动化安全验证的三阶段方法，通过虚拟化环境迭代优化，显著提升固件安全性和实时性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成嵌入式系统固件时经常引入安全漏洞且无法满足实时性能约束，需要系统化的安全验证和优化方法

Method: 三阶段方法：1）使用结构化提示和GPT-4等模型生成固件；2）在QEMU虚拟化环境中部署FreeRTOS进行测试；3）通过模糊测试、静态分析和运行时监控检测漏洞，AI代理协作进行迭代修复

Result: 漏洞修复率达到92.4%（提升37.3%），威胁模型符合度95.8%，安全覆盖指数0.87，实时性能：最坏情况执行时间8.6ms，抖动195μs

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升LLM生成固件的安全性和性能，并提供开源数据集支持未来研究

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in generating firmware for embedded
systems, but often introduce security flaws and fail to meet real-time
performance constraints. This paper proposes a three-phase methodology that
combines LLM-based firmware generation with automated security validation and
iterative refinement in a virtualized environment. Using structured prompts,
models like GPT-4 generate firmware for networking and control tasks, deployed
on FreeRTOS via QEMU. These implementations are tested using fuzzing, static
analysis, and runtime monitoring to detect vulnerabilities such as buffer
overflows (CWE-120), race conditions (CWE-362), and denial-of-service threats
(CWE-400). Specialized AI agents for Threat Detection, Performance
Optimization, and Compliance Verification collaborate to improve detection and
remediation. Identified issues are categorized using CWE, then used to prompt
targeted LLM-generated patches in an iterative loop. Experiments show a 92.4\%
Vulnerability Remediation Rate (37.3\% improvement), 95.8\% Threat Model
Compliance, and 0.87 Security Coverage Index. Real-time metrics include 8.6ms
worst-case execution time and 195{\mu}s jitter. This process enhances firmware
security and performance while contributing an open-source dataset for future
research.

### [6] [rCamInspector: Building Reliability and Trust on IoT (Spy) Camera Detection using XAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09989)
*Priyanka Rushikesh Chaudhary,Manan Gupta,Jabez Christopher,Putrevu Venkata Sai Charan,Rajib Ranjan Maiti*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: rCamInspector是一个基于可解释AI(XAI)的系统，用于IoT网络流量分类，使用XGBoost模型在Flow分类器和SmartCam分类器中分别达到92%和99%的准确率，并通过SHAP和LIME提供可信的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习模型在IoT网络安全分类中作为黑盒的问题，提供可靠和可信的解释来支持基于模型输出的关键决策。

Method: 设计rCamInspector系统，采用两个分类器：Flow分类器（4类）和SmartCam分类器（6类），使用8种监督ML模型，最终选择XGBoost，并应用SHAP和LIME进行特征解释。

Result: XGBoost在Flow分类器和SmartCam分类器中分别达到92%和99%的准确率；SHAP和LIME的一致性超过0.7，充分性为1.0；与传统互信息特征重要性相比，XAI方法提供更可靠的解释。

Conclusion: rCamInspector成功实现了高精度的IoT流量分类，并通过XAI方法提供了可信的解释，在准确率(99%)、精确率(99%)和假阴性率(0.7%)方面优于现有工作。

Abstract: The classification of network traffic using machine learning (ML) models is
one of the primary mechanisms to address the security issues in IoT networks
and/or IoT devices. However, the ML models often act as black-boxes that create
a roadblock to take critical decision based on the model output. To address
this problem, we design and develop a system, called rCamInspector, that
employs Explainable AI (XAI) to provide reliable and trustworthy explanations
to model output. rCamInspector adopts two classifiers, Flow Classifier -
categorizes a flow into one of four classes, IoTCam, Conf, Share and Others,
and SmartCam Classifier - classifies an IoTCam flow into one of six classes,
Netatmo, Spy Clock, Canary, D3D, Ezviz, V380 Spy Bulb; both are IP address and
transport port agnostic. rCamInspector is evaluated using 38GB of network
traffic and our results show that XGB achieves the highest accuracy of 92% and
99% in the Flow and SmartCam classifiers respectively among eight supervised ML
models. We analytically show that the traditional mutual information (MI) based
feature importance cannot provide enough reliability on the model output of XGB
in either classifiers. Using SHAP and LIME, we show that a separate set of
features can be picked up to explain a correct prediction of XGB. For example,
the feature Init Bwd Win Byts turns out to have the highest SHAP values to
support the correct prediction of both IoTCam in Flow Classifier and Netatmo
class in SmartCam Classifier. To evaluate the faithfulness of the explainers on
our dataset, we show that both SHAP and LIME have a consistency of more than
0.7 and a sufficiency of 1.0. Comparing with existing works, we show that
rCamInspector achieves a better accuracy (99%), precision (99%), and false
negative rate (0.7%).

### [7] [Why Data Anonymization Has Not Taken Off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10165)
*Matthew J. Schneider,James Bailie,Dawn Iacobucci*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 数据匿名化在实践中难以推广，因为实施复杂且需要针对具体案例定制化选择，差分隐私等方法的实际含义随选择变化而不同，企业应认识到匿名化只是数据隐私的一种方法，需要结合多种策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业寻求数据匿名化研究（如差分隐私和合成数据方法）作为简单的合规解决方案，但实践中发现这些方法实施复杂且需要针对具体案例进行定制化选择，无法简单推广。

Method: 分析数据匿名化实施中的复杂选择因素，包括数据集领域、保护单位、保护范围和保护标准等，指出这些选择会改变差分隐私等方法的实际含义和保护效果。

Result: 数据匿名化方法只有在所需洞察远大于保护单位时才有效，且需要保持数据模式与企业盈利性的关联，因此通常需要定制化解决方案，降低了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 企业不应期望简单解决方案，而应认识到数据匿名化只是数据隐私的一种方法，具有特定的优缺点，最佳策略是结合使用数据隐私和安全的全方位方法。

Abstract: Companies are looking to data anonymization research $\unicode{x2013}$
including differential private and synthetic data methods $\unicode{x2013}$ for
simple and straightforward compliance solutions. But data anonymization has not
taken off in practice because it is anything but simple to implement. For one,
it requires making complex choices which are case dependent, such as the domain
of the dataset to anonymize; the units to protect; the scope where the data
protection should extend to; and the standard of protection. Each variation of
these choices changes the very meaning, as well as the practical implications,
of differential privacy (or of any other measure of data anonymization). Yet
differential privacy is frequently being branded as the same privacy guarantee
regardless of variations in these choices. Some data anonymization methods can
be effective, but only when the insights required are much larger than the unit
of protection. Given that businesses care about profitability, any solution
must preserve the patterns between a firm's data and that profitability. As a
result, data anonymization solutions usually need to be bespoke and
case-specific, which reduces their scalability. Companies should not expect
easy wins, but rather recognize that anonymization is just one approach to data
privacy with its own particular advantages and drawbacks, while the best
strategies jointly leverage the full range of approaches to data privacy and
security in combination.

### [8] [Investigating Feature Attribution for 5G Network Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10206)
*Federica Uccello,Simin Nadjm-Tehrani*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文比较了SHAP和VoTE-XAI两种可解释AI方法在5G网络安全中的表现，发现VoTE-XAI能提供更简洁、稳定和高效的解释，特别是在高维特征场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着5G网络在关键应用中的普及，需要从恶意活动检测转向能够提供可靠判断的系统。理解机器学习模型的安全警报对于实现可操作的事件响应至关重要，而可解释AI技术可以通过提供警报原因来增强信任。

Method: 研究比较了两种XAI方法：基于统计特征关联的SHAP和基于逻辑解释的VoTE-XAI。分析了它们在三种不同用例中对XGBoost模型生成的5G通信攻击警报的解释能力，使用稀疏性、稳定性和效率三个指标进行评估。

Result: 在92个特征的5G网络中，VoTE-XAI对ICMPFlood DoS攻击仅识别出6个重要特征，而SHAP识别出20多个。两种方法选择的特征存在显著差异，但VoTE-XAI没有遗漏SHAP排名靠前的特征。VoTE-XAI在效率上明显更优，在478个特征的高维设置下，单个解释生成时间小于0.002秒。

Conclusion: 基于逻辑解释的VoTE-XAI方法相比传统的统计特征关联方法，在5G网络安全场景中能提供更简洁、稳定和高效的解释，有助于实现更好的事件响应编排。

Abstract: With the rise of fifth-generation (5G) networks in critical applications, it
is urgent to move from detection of malicious activity to systems capable of
providing a reliable verdict suitable for mitigation. In this regard,
understanding and interpreting machine learning (ML) models' security alerts is
crucial for enabling actionable incident response orchestration. Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques are expected to enhance trust by
providing insights into why alerts are raised. A dominant approach
statistically associates feature sets that can be correlated to a given alert.
This paper starts by questioning whether such attribution is relevant for
future generation communication systems, and investigates its merits in
comparison with an approach based on logical explanations. We extensively study
two methods, SHAP and VoTE-XAI, by analyzing their interpretations of alerts
generated by an XGBoost model in three different use cases with several 5G
communication attacks. We identify three metrics for assessing explanations:
sparsity, how concise they are; stability, how consistent they are across
samples from the same attack type; and efficiency, how fast an explanation is
generated. As an example, in a 5G network with 92 features, 6 were deemed
important by VoTE-XAI for a Denial of Service (DoS) variant, ICMPFlood, while
SHAP identified over 20. More importantly, we found a significant divergence
between features selected by SHAP and VoTE-XAI. However, none of the top-ranked
features selected by SHAP were missed by VoTE-XAI. When it comes to efficiency
of providing interpretations, we found that VoTE-XAI is significantly more
responsive, e.g. it provides a single explanation in under 0.002 seconds, in a
high-dimensional setting (478 features).

### [9] [Dynamic Vulnerability Patching for Heterogeneous Embedded Systems Using Stack Frame Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10213)
*Ming Zhou,Xupu Hu,Zhihao Wang,Haining Wang,Hui Wen,Limin Sun,Peng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: StackPatch是一个针对嵌入式设备的动态热补丁框架，通过栈帧重建和异常处理机制实现跨架构的漏洞修复，在ARM、RISC-V和Xtensa三种MCU架构上成功修复了102个RTOS漏洞，每个修复耗时少于260个时钟周期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态漏洞修补技术不适合嵌入式设备，特别是医疗设备等关键任务设备，因为这些设备计算能力和内存有限但需要不间断服务，缺乏足够的空闲内存用于动态修补，且嵌入式系统架构多样使得跨系统内核和硬件平台的补丁触发机制复杂。

Method: 提出基于栈帧重建的热补丁框架StackPatch，采用不同的触发策略更新内存单元中的程序，利用嵌入式处理器普遍可用的异常处理机制增强跨处理器架构的控制流重定向适应性。

Result: 在ARM、RISC-V和Xtensa三种主要MCU架构的嵌入式设备上评估，成功修复了实时操作系统中的102个公开漏洞，应用于医疗设备、软PLC和网络服务，每个漏洞修复均在260个MCU时钟周期内完成。

Conclusion: StackPatch框架有效解决了嵌入式设备动态漏洞修补的挑战，通过栈帧重建和异常处理机制实现了跨架构的高效漏洞修复，为关键任务嵌入式系统提供了可行的安全更新方案。

Abstract: Existing dynamic vulnerability patching techniques are not well-suited for
embedded devices, especially mission-critical ones such as medical equipment,
as they have limited computational power and memory but uninterrupted service
requirements. Those devices often lack sufficient idle memory for dynamic
patching, and the diverse architectures of embedded systems further complicate
the creation of patch triggers that are compatible across various system
kernels and hardware platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a hot
patching framework called StackPatch that facilitates patch development based
on stack frame reconstruction. StackPatch introduces different triggering
strategies to update programs stored in memory units. We leverage the
exception-handling mechanisms commonly available in embedded processors to
enhance StackPatch's adaptability across different processor architectures for
control flow redirection. We evaluated StackPatch on embedded devices featuring
three major microcontroller (MCU) architectures: ARM, RISC-V, and Xtensa. In
the experiments, we used StackPatch to successfully fix 102 publicly disclosed
vulnerabilities in real-time operating systems (RTOS). We applied patching to
medical devices, soft programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and network
services, with StackPatch consistently completing each vulnerability
remediation in less than 260 MCU clock cycles.

*Reynaldo Gil-Pons,Sjouke Mauw,Rolando Trujillo-Rasua*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次对基于软件的内存擦除协议进行了实证分析，评估了7种协议在3种不同计算能力的现代IoT设备上的安全性、擦除保证和性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于软件的内存擦除协议虽然经过理论分析，但缺乏在实际设备上的可行性、性能和安全性测试，这阻碍了其在工业界的采用。

Method: 实验设置包括3种现代IoT设备、7种协议、6种哈希函数实现，以及各种性能和安全性标准，通过实证分析评估协议的表现。

Result: 研究发现现有协议是可行的，但速度较慢的设备可能需要几秒钟来擦除内存并生成证明。网络速度和协议规范中的隐藏常数对性能的影响比文献预期的更重要。

Conclusion: 没有一种协议在所有实验设置中都占主导地位，研究提供了一个评估框架，可以根据所需的安全级别确定在性能和擦除保证之间提供最佳权衡的协议。

Abstract: Software-based memory-erasure protocols are two-party communication protocols
where a verifier instructs a computational device to erase its memory and send
a proof of erasure. They aim at guaranteeing that low-cost IoT devices are free
of malware by putting them back into a safe state without requiring secure
hardware or physical manipulation of the device. Several software-based
memory-erasure protocols have been introduced and theoretically analysed. Yet,
many of them have not been tested for their feasibility, performance and
security on real devices, which hinders their industry adoption. This article
reports on the first empirical analysis of software-based memory-erasure
protocols with respect to their security, erasure guarantees, and performance.
The experimental setup consists of 3 modern IoT devices with different
computational capabilities, 7 protocols, 6 hash-function implementations, and
various performance and security criteria. Our results indicate that existing
software-based memory-erasure protocols are feasible, although slow devices may
take several seconds to erase their memory and generate a proof of erasure. We
found that no protocol dominates across all empirical settings, defined by the
computational power and memory size of the device, the network speed, and the
required level of security. Interestingly, network speed and hidden constants
within the protocol specification played a more prominent role in the
performance of these protocols than anticipated based on the related
literature. We provide an evaluation framework that, given a desired level of
security, determines which protocols offer the best trade-off between
performance and erasure guarantees.

### [11] [ExDoS: Expert-Guided Dual-Focus Cross-Modal Distillation for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10252)
*Yifan Jia,Ye Tian,Yanbin Wang,Jianguo Sun,Haitao Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ExDoS是一个跨模态知识蒸馏框架，通过从源代码向字节码传输丰富的语义知识，提升智能合约漏洞检测性能，在真实合约上实现了3%-6%的F1分数提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约的闭源性质使得漏洞检测必须在字节码层面进行，这比基于源代码的分析更具挑战性。现有方法依赖图级对齐，掩盖了两种模态间的细粒度结构语义关联，且缺乏精确的漏洞模式和细粒度标注。

Method: 构建源代码语义图和字节码控制流图；提出双注意力图网络增强局部模式捕获；构建首个与源代码定义对齐的漏洞模式标注数据集；设计包含全局语义蒸馏损失和局部语义蒸馏损失的双焦点目标函数。

Result: 在真实世界合约上的实验表明，该方法相比强基线实现了3%-6%的F1分数一致提升。

Conclusion: ExDoS通过有效的跨模态知识蒸馏，成功将源代码的丰富语义知识传输到字节码分析中，显著提升了智能合约漏洞检测性能。

Abstract: The success of smart contracts has made them a target for attacks, but their
closed-source nature often forces vulnerability detection to work on bytecode,
which is inherently more challenging than source-code-based analysis. While
recent studies try to align source and bytecode embeddings during training to
transfer knowledge, current methods rely on graph-level alignment that obscures
fine-grained structural and semantic correlations between the two modalities.
Moreover, the absence of precise vulnerability patterns and granular
annotations in bytecode leads to depriving the model of crucial supervisory
signals for learning discriminant features. We propose ExDoS to transfer rich
semantic knowledge from source code to bytecode, effectively supplementing the
source code prior in practical settings. Specifically, we construct semantic
graphs from source code and control-flow graphs from bytecode. To address
obscured local signals in graph-level contract embeddings, we propose a
Dual-Attention Graph Network introducing a novel node attention aggregation
module to enhance local pattern capture in graph embeddings. Furthermore, by
summarizing existing source code vulnerability patterns and designing a
corresponding set of bytecode-level patterns for each, we construct the first
dataset of vulnerability pattern annotations aligned with source code
definitions to facilitate fine-grained cross-modal alignment and the capture of
function-level vulnerability signals. Finally, we propose a dual-focus
objective for our cross-modal distillation framework, comprising: a Global
Semantic Distillation Loss for transferring graph-level knowledge and a Local
Semantic Distillation Loss enabling expert-guided, fine-grained
vulnerability-specific distillation. Experiments on real-world contracts
demonstrate that our method achieves consistent F1-score improvements
(3\%--6\%) over strong baselines.

*Ye Tian,Yifan Jia,Yanbin Wang,Jianguo Sun,Zhiquan Liu,Xiaowen Ling*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多粒度图学习和语义嵌入的恶意URL检测方法，通过双粒度URL图（子词级和字符级）和BERT语义表示，使用门控动态融合网络整合特征，在多个维度上超越现有最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意URL检测面临两大挑战：互联网指数增长导致的URL多样性使得泛化检测困难，以及攻击者使用复杂混淆技术逃避检测。需要语义理解和上下文关系建模来解决这些问题。

Method: 构建双粒度URL图（子词级和字符级），使用字符级卷积网络初始化节点表示，通过联合训练的图卷积网络学习一致图级表示，结合BERT语义表示，最后使用门控动态融合网络整合特征。

Result: 该方法在多个挑战性维度上进行了广泛评估，结果显示超越了现有最佳性能，包括对抗大型语言模型的表现。

Conclusion: 提出的多粒度图学习与语义嵌入结合的方法能够有效捕获URL的语义、字符级和结构特征，为恶意URL检测提供了鲁棒的分析方案，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Malicious URL detection remains a major challenge in cybersecurity, primarily
due to two factors: (1) the exponential growth of the Internet has led to an
immense diversity of URLs, making generalized detection increasingly difficult;
and (2) attackers are increasingly employing sophisticated obfuscation
techniques to evade detection. We advocate that addressing these challenges
fundamentally requires: (1) obtaining semantic understanding to improve
generalization across vast and diverse URL sets, and (2) accurately modeling
contextual relationships within the structural composition of URLs. In this
paper, we propose a novel malicious URL detection method combining
multi-granularity graph learning with semantic embedding to jointly capture
semantic, character-level, and structural features for robust URL analysis. To
model internal dependencies within URLs, we first construct dual-granularity
URL graphs at both subword and character levels, where nodes represent URL
tokens/characters and edges encode co-occurrence relationships. To obtain
fine-grained embeddings, we initialize node representations using a
character-level convolutional network. The two graphs are then processed
through jointly trained Graph Convolutional Networks to learn consistent
graph-level representations, enabling the model to capture complementary
structural features that reflect co-occurrence patterns and character-level
dependencies. Furthermore, we employ BERT to derive semantic representations of
URLs for semantically aware understanding. Finally, we introduce a gated
dynamic fusion network to combine the semantically enriched BERT
representations with the jointly optimized graph vectors, further enhancing
detection performance. We extensively evaluate our method across multiple
challenging dimensions. Results show our method exceeds SOTA performance,
including against large language models.

Motivation: 分析E2EE技术在保护个人隐私和数字信任方面的关键作用，同时研究其对执法机构调查恶意活动的阻碍影响

Method: 通过理论分析和案例研究，探讨E2EE技术的双重角色及其在隐私保护与执法需求之间的平衡

Result: E2EE确实在保护隐私方面发挥重要作用，但同时也为恶意活动提供了隐蔽空间，形成了技术保护与执法需求之间的根本矛盾

Conclusion: 需要在E2EE技术发展和法律框架之间寻找平衡点，既保护个人隐私权利，又不完全阻碍合法的执法调查需求

Abstract: End-to-end encryption (E2EE) has emerged as a fundamental element of modern
digital communication, protecting data from unauthorized access during
transmission. By design, E2EE ensures that only the intended recipient can
decrypt the information, making it inaccessible even to service providers. Yet,
this powerful safeguard of individual privacy and digital trust also introduces
a paradox: it can simultaneously prevent law enforcement efforts by hiding
potential malicious activities. This paper examines the dual role of E2EE, its
critical importance to privacy, the challenges it

Abstract: Bitcoin's limited scripting capabilities and lack of native interoperability
mechanisms have constrained its integration into the broader blockchain
ecosystem, especially decentralized finance (DeFi) and multi-chain
applications. This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of Bitcoin
cross-chain bridge protocols, systematically analyzing their trust assumptions,
performance characteristics, and applicability to the Artificial Intelligence
of Things (AIoT) scenarios. We categorize bridge designs into three main types:
naive token swapping, pegged-asset bridges, and arbitrary-message bridges. Each
category is evaluated across key metrics such as trust model, latency, capital
efficiency, and DeFi composability. Emerging innovations like BitVM and
recursive sidechains are highlighted for their potential to enable secure,
scalable, and programmable Bitcoin interoperability. Furthermore, we explore
practical use cases of cross-chain bridges in AIoT applications, including
decentralized energy trading, healthcare data integration, and supply chain
automation. This taxonomy provides a foundational framework for researchers and
practitioners seeking to design secure and efficient cross-chain
infrastructures in AIoT systems.

Code:\n  https://github.com/kirudang/LDP_Stealing_Attack", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across\nvarious tasks. However, their deployment introduces significant risks related\nto intellectual property. In this context, we focus on model stealing attacks,\nwhere adversaries replicate the behaviors of these models to steal services.\nThese attacks are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose serious threats\nto revenue and financial stability. To mitigate these risks, the watermarking\nsolution embeds imperceptible patterns in LLM outputs, enabling model\ntraceability and intellectual property verification. In this paper, we study\nthe vulnerability of LLM service providers by introducing $\\delta$-STEAL, a\nnovel model stealing attack that bypasses the service provider's watermark\ndetectors while preserving the adversary's model utility. $\\delta$-STEAL\ninjects noise into the token embeddings of the adversary's model during\nfine-tuning in a way that satisfies local differential privacy (LDP)\nguarantees. The adversary queries the service provider's model to collect\noutputs and form input-output training pairs. By applying LDP-preserving noise\nto these pairs, $\\delta$-STEAL obfuscates watermark signals, making it\ndifficult for the service provider to determine whether its outputs were used,\nthereby preventing claims of model theft. Our experiments show that\n$\\delta$-STEAL with lightweight modifications achieves attack success rates of\nup to $96.95\\%$ without significantly compromising the adversary's model\nutility. The noise scale in LDP controls the trade-off between attack\neffectiveness and model utility. This poses a significant risk, as even robust\nwatermarks can be bypassed, allowing adversaries to deceive watermark detectors\nand undermine current intellectual property protection methods."}

Conventional solutions, including digital signatures\nbased on Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) and identity-based signatures, are\ninadequate against quantum-capable adversaries. While integrating NIST's\nPost-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards is a leading approach for quantum\nresistance, their suitability for 5G base station authentication remains\nunexplored. Moreover, current solutions are predominantly centralized and lack\nsecurity features such as distributed authentication. This work presents, to\nour knowledge, the first comprehensive network-level performance\ncharacterization of integrating NIST-PQC standards and conventional digital\nsignatures (including threshold and identity-based schemes) into 5G base\nstation authentication. Our findings reveal significant feasibility concerns,\nwith direct PQC adoption hindered by protocol constraints and large signature\nsizes. We also highlight the performance limitations of conventional methods\ndue to the overhead of certificate chains. To mitigate these challenges, we\npropose BORG, a transitional authentication solution based on a Hierarchical\nIdentity-Based Threshold Signature scheme with a Fail-Stop property. BORG\noffers post-mortem post-quantum forgery detection and distributed trust via\nthreshold and compact signatures, well-suited for 5G's stringent requirements.\nOur performance analysis underscores an important warning on the infeasibility\nof direct PQC integration and positions BORG as an effective transitional\nsolution toward future quantum-resilient 5G authentication."}

It can be leveraged to secure outsourced and multiparty\ncomputation. TFHE is a fast torus-based fully homomorphic encryption scheme\nthat allows both linear operations, as well as the evaluation of arbitrary\nnon-linear functions. It currently provides the fastest bootstrapping operation\nperformance of any other FHE scheme. Despite its fast performance, TFHE suffers\nfrom a considerably higher computational overhead for the evaluation of\nhomomorphic circuits. Computations in the encrypted domain are orders of\nmagnitude slower than their unencrypted equivalents. This bottleneck hinders\nthe widespread adoption of (T)FHE for the protection of sensitive data. While\nstate-of-the-art implementations focused on accelerating and outsourcing single\noperations, their scalability and practicality are constrained by high memory\nbandwidth costs. In order to overcome this, we propose an FPGA-based hardware\naccelerator for the evaluation of homomorphic circuits. Specifically, we design\na functionally complete TFHE processor for FPGA hardware capable of processing\ninstructions on the data completely on the FPGA. In order to achieve a higher\nthroughput from our TFHE processor, we implement an improved programmable\nbootstrapping module which outperforms the current state-of-the-art by 240\\% to\n480\\% more bootstrappings per second. Our efficient, compact, and scalable\ndesign lays the foundation for implementing complete FPGA-based TFHE processor\narchitectures."}

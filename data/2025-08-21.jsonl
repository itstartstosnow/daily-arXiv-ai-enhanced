We introduce CCFC (Core & Core-Full-Core), a\ndual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs'\nvulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks.\nCCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot\nprompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a\ncore-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or\nprefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural\npatterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response\nis selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring\nrobustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC\ncuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against\nstrong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on\nbenign queries.

In a simulated production test environment, which consisted of over\n1,000 Amazon S3 buckets with diverse access configurations, it was discovered\nthat over 80\\% of the alerts generated by default rules were classified as\nfalse positives, thus demonstrating the severity of the detection issue.

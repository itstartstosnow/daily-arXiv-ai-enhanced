To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose a novel defense method that explicitly accounts for\nthe responsive nature of real-world adversaries via two methodological\ninnovations: a novel Responsive CPI attack and an attack-defense arms race\nframework.

Software security best practices in the automotive sector\nare often an afterthought for developers. Thus, significant cybersecurity risks\nexist in the software supply chain of AVs, particularly when secure software\ndevelopment practices are not rigorously implemented. For example, Upstream's\n2024 Automotive Cybersecurity Report states that 49.5% of cyberattacks in the\nautomotive sector are related to exploiting security vulnerabilities in\nsoftware systems. In this chapter, we analyze security vulnerabilities in\nopen-source software components in AVs. We utilize static analyzers on popular\nopen-source AV software, such as Autoware, Apollo, and openpilot. Specifically,\nthis chapter covers: (1) prevalent software security vulnerabilities of AVs;\nand (2) a comparison of static analyzer outputs for different open-source AV\nrepositories. The goal is to inform researchers, practitioners, and\npolicymakers about the existing security flaws in the commonplace open-source\nsoftware ecosystem in the AV domain. The findings would emphasize the necessity\nof security best practices earlier in the software development lifecycle to\nreduce cybersecurity risks, thereby ensuring system reliability, safeguarding\nuser data, and maintaining public trust in an increasingly automated world."}

They achieve scale by executing transactions on a\nLayer 2 ledger, while periodically posting data and finalizing state on the\nLayer 1, either optimistically or via validity proofs. Their fees must\nsimultaneously reflect the pricing of three resources: L2 costs (e.g.,\nexecution), L1 DA, and underlying L1 gas costs for batch settlement and proof\nverification. In this work, we identify critical mis-pricings in existing\nrollup transaction fee mechanisms (TFMs) that allow for two powerful attacks.\nFirstly, an adversary can saturate the L2's DA batch capacity with\ncompute-light data-heavy transactions, forcing low-gas transaction batches that\nenable both L2 DoS attacks, and finality-delay attacks. Secondly, by crafting\nprover killer transactions that maximize proving cycles relative to the gas\ncharges, an adversary can effectively stall proof generation, delaying finality\nby hours and inflicting prover-side economic losses to the rollup at a minimal\ncost.\n  We analyze the above attack vectors across the major Ethereum rollups,\nquantifying adversarial costs and protocol losses. We find that the first\nattack enables periodic DoS on rollups, lasting up to 30 minutes, at a cost\nbelow 2 ETH for most rollups. Moreover, we identify three rollups that are\nexposed to indefinite DoS at a cost of approximately 0.8 to 2.7 ETH per hour.\nThe attack can be further modified to increase finalization delays by a factor\nof about 1.45x to 2.73x, compared to direct L1 blob-stuffing, depending on the\nrollup's parameters. Furthermore, we find that the prover killer attack induces\na finalization latency increase of about 94x.

Nevertheless, Federated Averaging (FedAvg), the\ncanonical FL algorithm, has proven poor convergence in heterogeneous\nenvironments where data distributions are non-independent and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) and client datasets are unbalanced, conditions frequently\nobserved in cybersecurity contexts. To overcome these challenges, several\nalternative FL strategies have been developed, yet their applicability to\nnetwork intrusion detection remains insufficiently explored. This study\nsystematically reviews and evaluates a range of FL methods in the context of\nintrusion detection for DDoS attacks. Using a dataset of network attacks within\na Kubernetes-based testbed, we assess convergence efficiency, computational\noverhead, bandwidth consumption, and model accuracy. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first comparative analysis of FL algorithms for\nintrusion detection under realistic non-i.i.d. and unbalanced settings,\nproviding new insights for the design of robust, privacypreserving network\nsecurity solutions."}

We show that these\nweighted-voting systems overturn existing notions of voter privacy. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that even with secret ballots, publishing raw tallies\noften reveals voters' choices.\n  Weighted voting thus requires a new framework for privacy. We introduce a\nnotion called B-privacy whose basis is bribery, a key problem in voting systems\ntoday. B-privacy captures the economic cost to an adversary of bribing voters\nbased on revealed voting tallies.\n  We propose a mechanism to boost B-privacy by noising voting tallies. We prove\nbounds on its tradeoff between B-privacy and transparency, meaning\nreported-tally accuracy. Analyzing 3,582 proposals across 30 Decentralized\nAutonomous Organizations (DAOs), we find that the prevalence of large voters\n(\"whales\") limits the effectiveness of any B-Privacy-enhancing technique.\nHowever, our mechanism proves to be effective in cases without extreme voting\nweight concentration: among proposals requiring coalitions of $\\geq5$ voters to\nflip outcomes, our mechanism raises B-privacy by a geometric mean factor of\n$4.1\\times$.\n  Our work offers the first principled guidance on transparency-privacy\ntradeoffs in weighted-voting systems, complementing existing approaches that\nfocus on ballot secrecy and revealing fundamental constraints that voting\nweight concentration imposes on privacy mechanisms."}

Distributed approaches,\nwhile promising, introduce additional risks such as denial-of-service\nvulnerabilities and operational complexity. We introduce Socarrat, a novel,\ncost-effective, and local WORM storage solution that leverages a simple\nexternal USB device (specifically, a single-board computer running Linux with\nUSB On-The-Go support). The resulting device can be connected via USB,\nappearing as an ordinary external disk formatted with an ext4 or exFAT file\nsystem, without requiring any specialized software or drivers. By isolating the\nWORM enforcement mechanism in a dedicated USB hardware module, Socarrat\nsignificantly reduces the attack surface and ensures that even privileged\nattackers cannot modify or erase stored data. In addition to the WORM capacity,\nthe system is designed to be tamper-evident, becoming resilient against\nadvanced attacks. This work describes a novel approach, the Reverse File\nSystem, based on inferring the file system operations occurring at higher\nlayers in the host computer where Socarrat is mounted.

However, auditing their\nempirical privacy remains challenging, as commonly used similarity metrics fail\nto effectively characterize privacy risk. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)\nhave recently emerged as a method for evaluating privacy leakage in synthetic\ndata, but their practical effectiveness is limited. Numerous attacks exist\nacross different threat models, each with distinct implementations targeting\nvarious sources of privacy leakage, making them difficult to apply\nconsistently. Moreover, no single attack consistently outperforms the others,\nleading to a routine underestimation of privacy risk.\n  To address these issues, we propose a unified, model-agnostic threat\nframework that deploys a collection of attacks to estimate the maximum\nempirical privacy leakage in synthetic datasets. We introduce Synth-MIA, an\nopen-source Python library that streamlines this auditing process through a\nnovel testbed that integrates seamlessly into existing synthetic data\nevaluation pipelines through a Scikit-Learn-like API. Our software implements\n13 attack methods through a Scikit-Learn-like API, designed to enable fast\nsystematic estimation of privacy leakage for practitioners as well as\nfacilitate the development of new attacks and experiments for researchers.\n  We demonstrate our framework's utility in the largest tabular synthesis\nprivacy benchmark to date, revealing that higher synthetic data quality\ncorresponds to greater privacy leakage, that similarity-based privacy metrics\nshow weak correlation with MIA results, and that the differentially private\ngenerator PATEGAN can fail to preserve privacy under such attacks. This\nunderscores the necessity of MIA-based auditing when designing and deploying\nTabular Generative Models."}

Testing these devices is crucial from a security perspective since\nvendors often use custom closed- or open-source software without documenting\nreleases and patches. Recent coverage-guided fuzzing solutions primarily test\nindividual processes, ignoring deep dependencies between daemons and their\npersistent internal state. This article presents STAFF, a firmware fuzzing\nframework for discovering bugs in Linux-based firmware built around three key\nideas: (a) user-driven multi-request recording, which monitors user\ninteractions with emulated firmware to capture request sequences involving\napplication-layer protocols (e.g., HTTP); (b) intra- and inter-process\ndependency detection, which uses whole-system taint analysis to track how input\nbytes influence user-space states, including files, sockets, and memory areas;\n(c) protocol-aware taint-guided fuzzing, which applies mutations to request\nsequences based on identified dependencies, exploiting multi-staged forkservers\nto efficiently checkpoint protocol states. When evaluating STAFF on 15\nLinux-based firmware targets, it identifies 42 bugs involving multiple network\nrequests and different firmware daemons, significantly outperforming existing\nstate-of-the-art fuzzing solutions in both the number and reproducibility of\ndiscovered bugs."}

Malicious participants can perform\nlabel flipping, inject backdoor triggers, or launch Sybil attacks to corrupt\nthe global model. This paper introduces Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), a\nnovel robust aggregation mechanism designed to defend against diverse\nadversarial behaviors in FL without prior knowledge of the attack type. HRA\ncombines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking of\nclients. In each round, it detects outlier model updates via distance-based\ngeometric analysis while continuously updating a trust score for each client\nbased on historical behavior. This hybrid approach enables adaptive filtering\nof suspicious updates and long-term penalization of unreliable clients,\ncountering attacks ranging from backdoor insertions to random noise Byzantine\nfailures. We evaluate HRA on a large-scale proprietary 5G network dataset (3M+\nrecords) and the widely used NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark under diverse\nadversarial attack scenarios. Experimental results reveal that HRA achieves\nrobust global model accuracy of up to 98.66% on the 5G dataset and 96.60% on\nNF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators such as Krum,\nTrimmed Mean, and Bulyan by significant margins. Our ablation studies further\ndemonstrate that the full hybrid system achieves 98.66% accuracy, while the\nanomaly-only and reputation-only variants drop to 84.77% and 78.52%,\nrespectively, validating the synergistic value of our dual-mechanism approach.\nThis demonstrates HRA's enhanced resilience and robustness in 5G/edge federated\nlearning deployments, even under significant adversarial conditions."}

This paper presents a comparative analysis of the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks for two leading publicly available LLMs, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and OpenAI's GPT-4 (specifically the GPT-4o mini model accessible in the free tier). The research utilized two main bypass strategies: 'self-bypass', where models were prompted to circumvent their own safety protocols, and 'cross-bypass', where one model generated adversarial prompts to exploit vulnerabilities in the other. Four attack methods were employed - direct injection, role-playing, context manipulation, and obfuscation - to generate five distinct categories of unsafe content: hate speech, illegal activities, malicious code, dangerous content, and misinformation. The success of the attack was determined by the generation of disallowed content, with successful jailbreaks assigned a severity score. The findings indicate a disparity in jailbreak susceptibility between 2.5 Flash and GPT-4, suggesting variations in their safety implementations or architectural design. Cross-bypass attacks were particularly effective, indicating that an ample amount of vulnerabilities exist in the underlying transformer architecture. This research contributes a scalable framework for automated AI red-teaming and provides data-driven insights into the current state of LLM safety, underscoring the complex challenge of balancing model capabilities with robust safety mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9Google Gemini 2.5 Flash\u548cOpenAI GPT-4o mini\u8fdb\u884c\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7ed5\u8fc7\u653b\u51fb\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u6613\u611f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7ed5\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u81ea\u6211\u7ed5\u8fc7\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7ed5\u8fc7\uff09\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u6ce8\u5165\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u64cd\u7eb5\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e94\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u88ab\u7981\u6b62\u5185\u5bb9\u6765\u5224\u5b9a\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0Gemini 2.5 Flash\u548cGPT-4\u5728\u8d8a\u72f1\u6613\u611f\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7ed5\u8fc7\u653b\u51fb\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8868\u660etransformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316AI\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, today's language models lack a mechanism for isolating user interactions and concurrent tasks, creating a new attack vector inherent to this new setting: cross-user poisoning (CUP). In a CUP attack, an adversary injects ordinary-looking messages that poison the persistent, shared state, which later triggers the agent to execute unintended, attacker-specified actions on behalf of benign users. We validate CUP on real systems, successfully attacking popular multi-user agents. To study the phenomenon systematically, we present MURMUR, a framework that composes single-user tasks into concurrent, group-based scenarios using an LLM to generate realistic, history-aware user interactions. We observe that CUP attacks succeed at high rates and their effects persist across multiple tasks, thus posing fundamental risks to multi-user LLM deployments.

These attacks, called Meltdown and Spectre, exploit the side effects of performance-enhancing features in modern microprocessors to expose secret data through side channels in the microarchitecture. The well known implementations of these attacks exploit cache-based side channels since they are the least noisy channels to exfiltrate data. While some software patches attempted to mitigate these attacks, they are ad-hoc and only try to fix the side effects of the vulnerabilites. They may also impose a performance overhead of up to 30%. In this paper, we present a microarchitecture-based solution for Meltdown and Spectre that addresses the vulnerabilities exploited by the attacks. Our solution prevents flushed instructions from exposing data to the cache. Our approach can also be extended to other memory structures in the microarchitecture thereby preventing variants of the attacks which exploit these memory structures. We further identify two new variant attacks based on exploiting the side effects of speculative and out-of-order execution and show how our solution can be used to prevent these attacks. Evaluation results show that our microarchitectural solution not only restores secure out-of-order and speculative execution, but also has relatively low overhead and does not significantly impact performance for most applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u9632\u5fa1Meltdown\u548cSpectre\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9632\u6b62\u5237\u65b0\u6307\u4ee4\u5411\u7f13\u5b58\u66b4\u9732\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u6062\u590d\u4e71\u5e8f\u548c\u63a8\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u4e71\u5e8f\u548c\u63a8\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0cMeltdown\u548cSpectre\u653b\u51fb\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u6027\u7684\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u66b4\u9732\u79d8\u5bc6\u6570\u636e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8865\u4e01\u53ea\u662f\u4e34\u65f6\u4fee\u590d\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u8fbe30%\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5237\u65b0\u6307\u4ee4\u5411\u7f13\u5b58\u66b4\u9732\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u5185\u5b58\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9632\u5fa1\u5404\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u6062\u590d\u4e71\u5e8f\u548c\u63a8\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5bf9\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Meltdown\u548cSpectre\u653b\u51fb\u5229\u7528\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

These resources are typically managed and controlled by aggregators that coordinate many resources to provide flexibility services. However, these aggregators and flexible energy resources are vulnerable, which could allow attackers to remotely control flexible energy resources to launch large-scale attacks on the grid. This paper investigates and evaluates the potential attack strategies that can be used to manipulate flexible energy resources to challenge the effectiveness of traditional grid stability measures and disrupt the first-swing stability of the power grid.

Existing benchmarks rely on synthetic datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017) or scripted replay frameworks, which fail to capture adaptive adversary behavior. Even MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations, while influential, are host-centric and assume malware-driven compromise, thereby under-representing stealthy, multi-stage intrusions across IT and OT domains. We present StealthCup, a novel evaluation methodology that operationalizes IDS benchmarking as an evasion-focused Capture-the-Flag competition. Professional penetration testers engaged in multi-stage attack chains on a realistic IT/OT testbed, with scoring penalizing IDS detections. The event generated structured attacker writeups, validated detections, and PCAPs, host logs, and alerts. Our results reveal that out of 32 exercised attack techniques, 11 were not detected by any IDS configuration. Open-source systems (Wazuh, Suricata) produced high false-positive rates >90%, while commercial tools generated fewer false positives but also missed more attacks. Comparison with the Volt Typhoon APT advisory confirmed strong realism: all 28 applicable techniques were exercised, 19 appeared in writeups, and 9 in forensic traces. These findings demonstrate that StealthCup elicits attacker behavior closely aligned with state-sponsored TTPs, while exposing blind spots across both open-source and commercial IDS. The resulting datasets and methodology provide a reproducible foundation for future stealth-focused IDS evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "StealthCup\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u53d1\u73b0\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5f00\u6e90IDS\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u76f2\u70b9\uff0c11\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u6280\u672f\u672a\u88ab\u4efb\u4f55IDS\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709IDS\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u811a\u672c\u91cd\u653e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\uff0cMITRE ATT&CK\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5f\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e3b\u673a\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9IT/OT\u6df7\u5408\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9690\u853d\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5165\u4fb5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u907f\u7684\u593a\u65d7\u7ade\u8d5b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u771f\u5b9eIT/OT\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u653b\u51fb\u94fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5aIDS\u68c0\u6d4b\u6765\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u53d6\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u572832\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\uff0c11\u79cd\u672a\u88ab\u4efb\u4f55IDS\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u62a5\u7387>90%\uff0c\u5546\u4e1a\u5de5\u5177\u8bef\u62a5\u8f83\u5c11\u4f46\u6f0f\u68c0\u66f4\u591a\uff1b\u4e0eVolt Typhoon APT\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "StealthCup\u80fd\u591f\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u652f\u6301\u653b\u51fb\u6280\u672f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u5546\u4e1aIDS\u7684\u76f2\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9690\u853d\u653b\u51fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this paper, we study the fixes of incomplete security bugs in the Linux kernel for the first time, and reveal their characteristics, root causes, as well as detection. We first construct a dataset of incomplete security bug fixes in the Linux kernel and answer the following three questions. What are the characteristics of incomplete security bug fixes in the Linux kernel? What are the root causes behind them? How should they be detected to reduce security risks?

While the increasing prevalence of LLM-powered applications provides users with unprecedented convenience, it also brings forth new security challenges. For such an emerging ecosystem, the security community lacks sufficient understanding of the LLM application ecosystem, especially regarding the capability boundaries of the applications themselves.\n  In this paper, we systematically analyzed the new development paradigm and defined the concept of the LLM app capability space. We also uncovered potential new risks beyond jailbreak that arise from ambiguous capability boundaries in real-world scenarios, namely, capability downgrade and upgrade. To evaluate the impact of these risks, we designed and implemented an LLM app capability evaluation framework, LLMApp-Eval. First, we collected application metadata across 4 platforms and conducted a cross-platform ecosystem analysis. Then, we evaluated the risks for 199 popular applications among 4 platforms and 6 open-source LLMs. We identified that 178 (89.45%) potentially affected applications, which can perform tasks from more than 15 scenarios or be malicious. We even found 17 applications in our study that executed malicious tasks directly, without applying any adversarial rewriting. Furthermore, our experiments also reveal a positive correlation between the quality of prompt design and application robustness. We found that well-designed prompts enhance security, while poorly designed ones can facilitate abuse. We hope our work inspires the community to focus on the real-world risks of LLM applications and foster the development of a more robust LLM application ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u5e94\u7528\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86LLM\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7a7a\u95f4\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u8d8a\u72f1\u7684\u65b0\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u80fd\u529b\u964d\u7ea7\u548c\u5347\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86LLMApp-Eval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b089.45%\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u793e\u533a\u5bf9LLM\u5e94\u7528\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u5e94\u7528\u81ea\u8eab\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86LLM\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6LLMApp-Eval\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e864\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9199\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u548c6\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0178\u4e2a\uff0889.45%\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53ef\u6267\u884c15+\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53d1\u73b017\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u6267\u884c\u6076\u610f\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u6fc0\u53d1\u793e\u533a\u5173\u6ce8LLM\u5e94\u7528\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5065\u58ee\u7684LLM\u5e94\u7528\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We therefore propose automated permission management for AI agents. Our key idea is to conduct a user study to identify the factors influencing users' permission decisions and to encode these factors into an ML-based permission management assistant capable of predicting users' future decisions. We find that participants' permission decisions are influenced by communication context but importantly individual preferences tend to remain consistent within contexts, and align with those of other participants. Leveraging these insights, we develop a permission prediction model achieving 85.1% accuracy overall and 94.4% for high-confidence predictions.

Despite that GFMs have attracted considerable attention recently, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. A compromised GFM can introduce backdoor behaviors into downstream applications, posing serious security risks. However, launching backdoor attacks against GFMs is non-trivial due to three key challenges. (1) Effectiveness: Attackers lack knowledge of the downstream task during pre-training, complicating the assurance that triggers reliably induce misclassifications into desired classes. (2) Stealthiness: The variability in node features across domains complicates trigger insertion that remains stealthy. (3) Persistence: Downstream fine-tuning may erase backdoor behaviors by updating model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose GFM-BA, a novel Backdoor Attack model against Graph Foundation Models. Specifically, we first design a label-free trigger association module that links the trigger to a set of prototype embeddings, eliminating the need for knowledge about downstream tasks to perform backdoor injection. Then, we introduce a node-adaptive trigger generator, dynamically producing node-specific triggers, reducing the risk of trigger detection while reliably activating the backdoor. Lastly, we develop a persistent backdoor anchoring module that firmly anchors the backdoor to fine-tuning-insensitive parameters, enhancing the persistence of the backdoor under downstream adaptation.

Values evolve over time and influence one another across sequences. These correlations improve prediction in healthcare, finance, and smart-city control yet violate the record-independence assumption built into most Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. To restore rigorous privacy guarantees without sacrificing utility, we introduce Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy (CSDP), a framework specifically designed for preserving privacy in correlated sequential data. CSDP addresses two linked challenges: quantifying the extra information an attacker gains from joint temporal and cross-sequence links, and adding just enough noise to hide that information while keeping the data useful. We model multivariate streams as a Coupling Markov Chain, yielding the derived loose leakage bound expressed with a few spectral terms and revealing a counterintuitive result: stronger coupling can actually decrease worst-case leakage by dispersing perturbations across sequences. Guided by these bounds, we build the Freshness-Regulated Adaptive Noise (FRAN) mechanism--combining data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise--that runs in linear time. Tests on two-sequence datasets show that CSDP improves the privacy-utility trade-off by approximately 50% over existing correlated-DP methods and by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard DP approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u5e8f\u5217\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1(CSDP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u62a4\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6d41\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86FRAN\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u7ea650%\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u901a\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6d41\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5bbd\u677e\u6cc4\u9732\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86FRAN\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u8001\u5316\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53cc\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0cCSDP\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u76f8\u5173DP\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u7ea650%\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6DP\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "CSDP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7528\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6563\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6cc4\u9732\u3002"}}

Despite the proliferation of IoT security guidelines, a unified and quantitative approach to measuring trust remains absent. This paper introduces SCI-IoT (Secure Certification Index for IoT), a standardized and quantitative framework for trust scoring, evaluation, and certification of IoT devices.\n  The framework employs a six-tier grading model (Grades A-F), enabling device profiling across consumer, industrial, and critical infrastructure domains. Within this model, 30 distinct Trust Tests assess devices across dimensions such as authentication, encryption, data integrity, resilience, and firmware security. Each test is assigned a criticality-based weight (1.0-2.0) and a performance rating (1-4), converted to a normalized percentage and aggregated through a weighted computation to yield the Secure Certification Index (SCI). The SCI determines the device's Trust Verdict, categorized into five SCI levels, and serves as the foundation for optional grade-based certification. The framework also incorporates critical gate conditions, enforcing absolute compliance in high risk parameters to prevent certification of devices with fundamental vulnerabilities. By unifying quantitative trust scoring with structured certification criteria, SCI-IoT provides a transparent, scalable, and reproducible method to benchmark IoT device trustworthiness. The proposed system aims to streamline manufacturer compliance, improve consumer confidence, and facilitate global interoperability in IoT security certification.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCI-IoT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u7b49\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u548c30\u4e2a\u4fe1\u4efb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8bbe\u5907\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u5357\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u4fe1\u4efb\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u516d\u7b49\u7ea7\u5206\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff08A-F\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc730\u4e2a\u4fe1\u4efb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3001\u52a0\u5bc6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u6027\u6743\u91cd\uff081.0-2.0\uff09\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u7ea7\uff081-4\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\uff0c\u52a0\u6743\u6c47\u603b\u5f97\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6307\u6570\u3002", "result": "SCI-IoT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u5b9a\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u88c1\u51b3\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2aSCI\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9009\u7b49\u7ea7\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5305\u542b\u5173\u952e\u95e8\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SCI-IoT\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9a\u91cf\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u57fa\u51c6\u5316\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u5236\u9020\u5546\u5408\u89c4\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5168\u7403\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002"}}

While ABAC provides fine-grained, context-aware access management, the increasing number and complexity of access policies can make their formulation and evaluation rather challenging. To address the task of synthesizing concise yet accurate policies, we evaluate the performance of some of the state-of-the-art LLMs, specifically Google Gemini (Flash and Pro) and OpenAI ChatGPT, as potential policy mining engines. An experimental framework was developed in Python to generate randomized access data parameterized by varying numbers of subjects, objects, and initial policy sets. The baseline policy sets, which govern permission decisions between subjects and objects, serve as the ground truth for comparison. Each LLM-generated policy was evaluated against the baseline policy using standard performance metrics. The results indicate that LLMs can effectively infer compact and valid ABAC policies for small-scale scenarios. However, as the system size increases, characterized by higher numbers of subjects and objects, LLM outputs exhibit declining accuracy and precision, coupled with significant increase in the size of policy generated, which is beyond the optimal size. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLM architectures for scalable policy mining in access control domains. Future work will explore hybrid approaches that combine prompt optimization with classical rule mining algorithms to improve scalability and interpretability in complex ABAC environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u6316\u6398\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\u7d27\u51d1\u6709\u6548\u7684ABAC\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u89c4\u6a21\u8d85\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "ABAC\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u8bbf\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u4f7f\u5176\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6316\u6398\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5408\u6210\u7b80\u6d01\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Python\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u968f\u673a\u8bbf\u95ee\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Google Gemini\u548cOpenAI ChatGPT\u7b49\u6700\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6316\u6398\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\u7d27\u51d1\u6709\u6548\u7684ABAC\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u4e3b\u4f53\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0cLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u89c4\u6a21\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e14\u8d85\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u9762\u65e2\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4e5f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u63a2\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742ABAC\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional software, AI agents leverage LLMs as their \"brain\" to autonomously perform actions via connected tools. This capability introduces significant risks that go far beyond those of harmful text presented in a chatbot that was the main application of LLMs. A compromised AI agent can deliberately abuse powerful tools to perform malicious actions, in many cases irreversible, and limited solely by the guardrails on the tools themselves and the LLM ability to enforce them. This paper presents ASTRA, a first-of-its-kind framework designed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting the creation of secure agents that enforce custom guardrails defined at the system-prompt level (e.g., \"Do not send an email out of the company domain,\" or \"Never extend the robotic arm in more than 2 meters\").\n  Our holistic framework simulates 10 diverse autonomous agents varying between a coding assistant and a delivery drone equipped with 37 unique tools. We test these agents against a suite of novel attacks developed specifically for agentic threats, inspired by the OWASP Top 10 but adapted to challenge the ability of the LLM for policy enforcement during multi-turn planning and execution of strict tool activation. By evaluating 13 open-source, tool-calling LLMs, we uncovered surprising and significant differences in their ability to remain secure and keep operating within their boundaries.

However, strict isolation and maintaining runtime security in these environments has become increasingly challenging. Existing approaches like seccomp and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) frameworks offer some protection up to a limit, but often lack context awareness, syscall argument filtering, and adaptive enforcement, providing the ability to adjust decisions at runtime based on observed application behavior, workload changes, or detected anomalies rather than relying solely on static or predefined rules.This paper introduces eBPF-PATROL (eBPF-Protective Agent for Threat Recognition and Overreach Limitation), an extensible lightweight runtime security agent that uses extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to monitor and enforce policies in containerized and virtualized environments. By intercepting system calls, analyzing execution context, and applying user-defined rules, eBPF-PATROL detects and prevents real-time boundary violations, such as reverse shells, privilege escalation, and container escape attempts.

Deep Reinforcement Learning-based IDS, have shown promise due to their adaptive and generalization capabilities. However, recent studies reveal their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, including Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which can deceive models with a single, input-agnostic perturbation. In this work, we propose a novel UAP attack against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS under the domain-specific constraints derived from network data rules and feature relationships. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study that has explored UAP generation for the DRL-based IDS. In addition, this is the first work that focuses on developing a UAP against a DRL-based IDS under realistic domain constraints based on not only the basic domain rules but also mathematical relations between the features. Furthermore, we enhance the evasion performance of the proposed UAP, by introducing a customized loss function based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and we denote it as Customized UAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work using the PCC value in the UAP generation, even in the broader context. Four additional established UAP baselines are implemented for a comprehensive comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Customized UAP outperforms two input-dependent attacks including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and four UAP baselines, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world adversarial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8003\u8651\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684Pearson\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u589e\u5f3a\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684UAP\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9645\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Customized UAP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8ePearson\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Customized UAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e24\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08FGSM\u3001BIM\uff09\u548c\u56db\u79cdUAP\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9645\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents an edge-centric Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework that integrates lightweight machine learning (ML) based IDS models with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to improve detection accuracy, semantic interpretability, and operational efficiency at the network edge. The system evaluates six ML-based IDS models: Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model on low-power edge gateways, achieving accuracy up to 98 percent under real-world cyberattacks. For anomaly detection, the system transmits a compact and secure telemetry snapshot (for example, CPU usage, memory usage, latency, and energy consumption) via low-bandwidth API calls to LLMs including GPT-4-turbo, DeepSeek V2, and LLaMA 3.5. These models use zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought reasoning to produce human-readable threat analyses and actionable mitigation recommendations. Evaluations across diverse attacks such as DoS, DDoS, brute force, and port scanning show that the system enhances interpretability while maintaining low latency (<1.5 s), minimal bandwidth usage (<1.2 kB per prompt), and energy efficiency (<75 J), demonstrating its practicality and scalability as an IDS solution for edge gateways.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u5173\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u62a4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u514d\u53d7\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u5173\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u79cdML\u6a21\u578b\uff08DT\u3001KNN\u3001RF\u3001CNN\u3001LSTM\u3001CNN-LSTM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbdAPI\u8c03\u7528\u5c06\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9065\u6d4b\u5feb\u7167\u4f20\u8f93\u7ed9LLMs\uff08GPT-4-turbo\u3001DeepSeek V2\u3001LLaMA 3.5\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523098%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf<1.5\u79d2\uff0c\u5e26\u5bbd\u4f7f\u7528<1.2kB/\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u8017<75J\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u5173IDS\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Operating in a decentralized manner, SSI enables the verification of claims, including privacy-preserving mechanisms. Blockchain, which can be used to implement a Verifiable Data Registry (VDR), is often considered one of the pillars of SSI, along with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Unfortunately, blockchains are mostly siloed, affecting the interoperability and universality of SSI. We investigate the effect of blockchain isolation on blockchain-based SSI. We first define possible scenarios for cross-chain SSI and exemplify with real-life use cases. We then define specific requirements for cross-chain SSI and identify challenges, also in relation to the identified scenarios.

The proposed PUF generates device-specific responses by measuring the pull-up and pull-down resistor values on the I/O pins of the ICs, which naturally vary across chips due to manufacturing-induced process variations. Since these resistors are already integrated into the I/O structures of most ICs, ioPUF+ requires no custom circuitry, and no new IC fabrication. This makes ioPUF+ suitable for cost-sensitive embedded systems built from Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. Beyond introducing a new PUF, ioPUF+ includes a complete datapath for converting raw PUF responses into cryptographically usable secret keys using BCH error correction and SHA-256 hashing. Further ioPUF+ also demonstrate a practical use case of PUF derive secret keys in securing device-to-device communication using AES-encryption. We implemented ioPUF+ on the Infineon PSoC-5 microcontroller and evaluated its performance across 30 devices using standard PUF metrics. The results show excellent reliability (intra-device Hamming distance of 100.00%), strong uniqueness (inter-device Hamming distance of 50.33%), near-ideal uniformity (50.54%), and negligible bit aliasing. Stability tests under temperature and supply-voltage variations show worst-case bit-error rates of only 2.63% and 2.10%, respectively. We also profiled the resource and energy usage of the complete ioPUF+ system, including the PUF primitive, BCH decoding, SHA-256 hashing, and AES encryption. The full implementation requires only 19.8 KB of Flash, exhibits a latency of 600 ms, and consumes 79 mW of power, demonstrating the suitabilitiy of ioPUF+ for resource-constrained IoT nodes.", "AI": {"tldr": "ioPUF+\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u514b\u9686\u51fd\u6570(PUF)\uff0c\u5229\u7528IC\u82af\u7247I/O\u5f15\u811a\u7684\u4e0a\u62c9/\u4e0b\u62c9\u7535\u963b\u503c\u53d8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u5907\u552f\u4e00\u6307\u7eb9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5546\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u6570\u636e\u901a\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u5b9a\u5236\u7535\u8def\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709IC\u5236\u9020\u5de5\u827a\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u5907\u552f\u4e00\u6807\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cfIC\u82af\u7247I/O\u5f15\u811a\u7684\u4e0a\u62c9\u548c\u4e0b\u62c9\u7535\u963b\u503c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u827a\u53d8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u5907\u7279\u5b9a\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408BCH\u7ea0\u9519\u548cSHA-256\u54c8\u5e0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cbPUF\u54cd\u5e94\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u52a0\u5bc6\u53ef\u7528\u5bc6\u94a5\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0AES\u52a0\u5bc6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "result": "\u572830\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u53ef\u9760\u6027100%\u3001\u72ec\u7279\u602750.33%\u3001\u5747\u5300\u602750.54%\u3001\u4f4d\u522b\u540d\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff1b\u6e29\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u6700\u5dee\u8bef\u7801\u73872.63%\u3001\u7535\u538b\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b2.10%\uff1b\u5b8c\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u970019.8KB Flash\u3001600ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u300179mW\u529f\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "ioPUF+\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684PUF\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b9a\u5236IC\u5236\u9020\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u529f\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, when applied to large-scale firmware, their performance degrades due to the binary nature of firmware, complex dependency structures, and heterogeneous components. To address this challenge, this paper presents FIRMHIVE, a recursive agent hive that enables LLMs to act as autonomous firmware security analysts. FIRMHIVE introduces two key mechanisms: (1) transforming delegation into a per-agent, executable primitive and (2) constructing a runtime Tree of Agents (ToA) for decentralized coordination. We evaluate FIRMHIVE using real-world firmware images obtained from publicly available datasets, covering five representative security analysis tasks. Compared with existing LLM-agent baselines, FIRMHIVE performs deeper (about 16x more reasoning steps) and broader (about 2.3x more files inspected) cross-file exploration, resulting in about 5.6x more alerts per firmware.

While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5371\u9669\u573a\u666f\uff08\u6076\u610f\u7528\u6237+\u826f\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u826f\u6027\u7528\u6237+\u6076\u610f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86IMBIA\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cAdv-IMBIA\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u9669\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86IMBIA\uff08\u9690\u5f0f\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u770b\u4f3c\u826f\u6027\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9690\u85cf\u6076\u610f\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Adv-IMBIA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5728ChatDev\u3001MetaGPT\u548cAgentVerse\u6846\u67b6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "IMBIA\u5728MU-BA\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a93%\u300145%\u548c71%\uff0c\u5728BU-MA\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e3a71%\u300184%\u548c45%\u3002\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728MU-BA\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u88ab\u5165\u4fb5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65bd\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

Challenges remain in the trustworthiness of the data sources and the security of the trading process, particularly when there is no trust between the data providers and consumers. In this paper, we propose DEXO, a decentralized data exchange mechanism that facilitates secure and fair data exchange between data consumers and distributed IoT/mobile data providers at scale, allowing the consumer to verify the data generation process and the providers to be compensated for providing authentic data, with correctness guarantees from the exchange platform. To realize this, DEXO extends the decentralized oracle network model that has been successful in the blockchain applications domain to incorporate novel hardware-cryptographic co-design that harmonizes trusted execution environment, secret sharing, and smart contract-assisted fair exchange. For the first time, DEXO ensures end-to-end data confidentiality, source verifiability, and fairness of the exchange process with strong resilience against participant collusion. We implemented a prototype of the DEXO system to demonstrate feasibility. The evaluation shows a moderate deployment cost and significantly improved blockchain operation efficiency compared to a popular data exchange mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "DEXO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u4fe1\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u3001\u79d8\u5bc6\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\u3001\u6765\u6e90\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u786c\u4ef6-\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u53ef\u4fe1\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u3001\u79d8\u5bc6\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u9002\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u6bd4\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DEXO\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\u3001\u6765\u6e90\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5408\u8c0b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u97e7\u6027\u3002"}}

The advent of fifth-generation and beyond cellular networks (B5G) introduces emerging compute capabilities into the Radio Access Network (RAN), transforming it from a traditionally closed, vendor-locked infrastructure into an open and programmable ecosystem. This evolution, exemplified by Open-RAN (O-RAN), enables the deployment of control-plane applications from diverse sources, which can dynamically influence user-plane traffic in response to real-time events. As cellular infrastructures become more disaggregated and software-driven, security becomes an increasingly critical concern. Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a promising security paradigm that discards implicit trust assumptions by acknowledging that threats may arise from both external and internal sources. ZTA mandates comprehensive and fine-grained security mechanisms across both control and user planes to contain adversarial movements and enhance breach detection and attack response actions. In this paper, we explore the adoption of ZTA in the context of 5G and beyond, with a particular focus on O-RAN as an architectural enabler.

In general, existing jailbreak techniques either optimize a semantic template intended to induce the LLM to produce harmful outputs or optimize a suffix that leads the LLM to initiate its response with specific tokens (e.g., \"Sure\").\n  In this work, we introduce TASO (Template and Suffix Optimization), a novel jailbreak method that optimizes both a template and a suffix in an alternating manner. Our insight is that suffix optimization and template optimization are complementary to each other: suffix optimization can effectively control the first few output tokens but cannot control the overall quality of the output, while template optimization provides guidance for the entire output but cannot effectively control the initial tokens, which significantly impact subsequent responses.

Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts. Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics. These \"one-shot\" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks.\n  We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process. By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair. The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates.\n  We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet).

While machine learning-based intrusion detection has been widely explored, such methods have not demonstrated detection and mitigation within the required real-time budget. In contrast, cryptographic authentication has emerged as a practical candidate for real-time cyber defense, as specified in IEC 62351. In addition, lightweight rule-based intrusion detection that validates IEC 61850 semantics can provide specification-based detection of anomalous or malicious traffic with minimal processing delay. This paper presents the design logic and implementation aspects of three potential real-time mitigation techniques capable of countering GOOSE-based attacks: (i) IEC 62351-compliant message authentication code (MAC) scheme, (ii) a semantics-enforced rule-based intrusion detection system (IDS), and (iii) a hybrid approach integrating both MAC verification and Intrusion Detection System (IDS). A comparative evaluation of these real-time mitigation approaches is conducted using a cyber-physical system (CPS) security testbed. The results show that the hybrid integration significantly enhances mitigation capability. Furthermore, the processing delays of all three methods remain within the strict delivery requirements of GOOSE communication.

To protect these assets in the deployed environment, recent research has proposed model usage control mechanisms to ensure models cannot be used without proper authorization. These methods typically lock the utility of the model by embedding an access key into its parameters. However, they often assume static deployment, and largely fail to withstand continual post-deployment model updates, such as fine-tuning or task-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose ADALOC, to endow key-based model usage control with adaptability during model evolution. It strategically selects a subset of weights as an intrinsic access key, which enables all model updates to be confined to this key throughout the evolution lifecycle. ADALOC enables using the access key to restore the keyed model to the latest authorized states without redistributing the entire network (i.e., adaptation), and frees the model owner from full re-keying after each model update (i.e., lock preservation). We establish a formal foundation to underpin ADALOC, providing crucial bounds such as the errors introduced by updates restricted to the access key. Experiments on standard benchmarks, such as CIFAR-100, Caltech-256, and Flowers-102, and modern architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and ConvNeXt, demonstrate that ADALOC achieves high accuracy under significant updates while retaining robust protections. Specifically, authorized usages consistently achieve strong task-specific performance, while unauthorized usage accuracy drops to near-random guessing levels (e.g., 1.01% on CIFAR-100), compared to up to 87.01% without ADALOC. This shows that ADALOC can offer a practical solution for adaptive and protected DNN deployment in evolving real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADALOC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u8bbf\u95ee\u5bc6\u94a5\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u53d1\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u9501\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u9759\u6001\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\uff08\u5982\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fdd\u62a4\u5931\u6548\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u6743\u91cd\u5b50\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u5728\u8bbf\u95ee\u5bc6\u94a5\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u9650\u5236\u5728\u8be5\u5bc6\u94a5\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bbf\u95ee\u5bc6\u94a5\u5c06\u5bc6\u94a5\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u5230\u6700\u65b0\u6388\u6743\u72b6\u6001\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u53d1\u6574\u4e2a\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001Caltech-256\u3001Flowers-102\u7b49\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cResNet\u3001DenseNet\u3001ConvNeXt\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\uff0cADALOC\u5728\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u6388\u6743\u4f7f\u7528\u8fbe\u5230\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u672a\u6388\u6743\u4f7f\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u81f3\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u731c\u6d4b\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u5982CIFAR-100\u4e0a1.01%\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u672a\u7ecfADALOC\u4fdd\u62a4\u53ef\u8fbe87.01%\u3002", "conclusion": "ADALOC\u4e3a\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684DNN\u90e8\u7f72\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper presents RoguePrompt, an automated jailbreak attack that converts a disallowed user query into a self reconstructing prompt which passes provider moderation while preserving the original harmful intent. RoguePrompt partitions the instruction across two lexical streams, applies nested classical ciphers, and wraps the result in natural language directives that cause the target model to decode and execute the hidden payload. Our attack assumes only black box access to the model and to the associated moderation endpoint. We instantiate RoguePrompt against GPT 4o and evaluate it on 2 448 prompts that a production moderation system previously marked as strongly rejected. Under an evaluation protocol that separates three security relevant outcomes bypass, reconstruction, and execution the attack attains 84.7 percent bypass, 80.2 percent reconstruction, and 71.5 percent full execution, substantially outperforming five automated jailbreak baselines. We further analyze the behavior of several automated and human aligned evaluators and show that dual layer lexical transformations remain effective even when detectors rely on semantic similarity or learned safety rubrics. Our results highlight systematic blind spots in current moderation practice and suggest that robust deployment will require joint reasoning about user intent, decoding workflows, and model side computation rather than surface level toxicity alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoguePrompt\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7981\u6b62\u7684\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u6211\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u5ba1\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u3001\u4e13\u7528\u5ba1\u6838\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5371\u9669\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66b4\u9732\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f2\u70b9\u3002", "method": "RoguePrompt\u5c06\u6307\u4ee4\u5206\u5272\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bcd\u6c47\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u5bc6\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u88c5\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8f7d\u8377\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5ba1\u6838\u7aef\u70b9\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT-4o\u4e0a\u5bf92,448\u4e2a\u88ab\u751f\u4ea7\u5ba1\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f3a\u70c8\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u83b7\u5f97\u4e8684.7%\u7684\u7ed5\u8fc7\u7387\u300180.2%\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u7387\u548c71.5%\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u6267\u884c\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e94\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8d8a\u72f1\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u91cd\u8bcd\u6c47\u8f6c\u6362\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6216\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5ba1\u6838\u5b9e\u8df5\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u76f2\u70b9\uff0c\u7a33\u5065\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u8868\u9762\u6bd2\u6027\u3002"}}

This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

To enhance LLM safety, various jailbreak defense methods have been proposed to guard against harmful outputs. However, improvements in model safety often come at the cost of severe over-refusal, failing to strike a good balance between safety and usability. In this paper, we first analyze the causes of over-refusal from a representation perspective, revealing that over-refusal samples reside at the boundary between benign and malicious samples. Based on this, we propose MOSR, designed to mitigate over-refusal by intervening the safety representation of LLMs. MOSR incorporates two novel components: (1) Overlap-Aware Loss Weighting, which determines the erasure weight for malicious samples by quantifying their similarity to pseudo-malicious samples in the representation space, and (2) Context-Aware Augmentation, which supplements the necessary context for rejection decisions by adding harmful prefixes before rejection responses. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in mitigating over-refusal while largely maintaining safety. Overall, we advocate that future defense methods should strike a better balance between safety and over-refusal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMOSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e72\u9884\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMOSR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u6709\u5bb3\u524d\u7f00\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMOSR\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u6027", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861"}}

Benchmarking Potential Existential Threats from LLMs via Prefix Completion", "comment": null, "summary": "Research on the safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has become extensive, driven by jailbreak studies that elicit unsafe responses. Such response involves information already available to humans, such as the answer to \"how to make a bomb\". When LLMs are jailbroken, the practical threat they pose to humans is negligible. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs commonly produce unpredictable outputs that could pose substantive threats to human safety. To address this gap, we study whether LLM-generated content contains potential existential threats, defined as outputs that imply or promote direct harm to human survival. We propose \\textsc{ExistBench}, a benchmark designed to evaluate such risks. Each sample in \\textsc{ExistBench} is derived from scenarios where humans are positioned as adversaries to AI assistants. Unlike existing evaluations, we use prefix completion to bypass model safeguards. This leads the LLMs to generate suffixes that express hostility toward humans or actions with severe threat, such as the execution of a nuclear strike. Our experiments on 10 LLMs reveal that LLM-generated content indicates existential threats. To investigate the underlying causes, we also analyze the attention logits from LLMs. To highlight real-world safety risks, we further develop a framework to assess model behavior in tool-calling. We find that LLMs actively select and invoke external tools with existential threats.

Authors marked with * contributed equally. Yi Liu is the lead author", "summary": "With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

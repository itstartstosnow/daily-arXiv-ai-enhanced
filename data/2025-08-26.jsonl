While typically considered\ncyber-physical systems (CPSs), their dependence on traditional networked\nsoftware stacks (e.g., Linux operating systems), robot operating system (ROS)\nmiddleware, and over-the-air update channels, creates a distinct security\nprofile that exposes them to vulnerabilities conventional CPS models do not\nfully address. Prior studies have mainly examined specific threats, such as\nLiDAR spoofing or adversarial machine learning (AML). This narrow focus\noverlooks how an attack targeting one component can cascade harm throughout the\nrobot's interconnected systems. We address this gap through a systematization\nof knowledge (SoK) that takes a comprehensive approach, consolidating\nfragmented research from robotics, CPS, and network security domains. We\nintroduce a seven-layer security model for humanoid robots, organizing 39 known\nattacks and 35 defenses across the humanoid ecosystem-from hardware to\nhuman-robot interaction. Building on this security model, we develop a\nquantitative 39x35 attack-defense matrix with risk-weighted scoring, validated\nthrough Monte Carlo analysis. We demonstrate our method by evaluating three\nreal-world robots: Pepper, G1 EDU, and Digit. The scoring analysis revealed\nvarying security maturity levels, with scores ranging from 39.9% to 79.5%\nacross the platforms. This work introduces a structured, evidence-based\nassessment method that enables systematic security evaluation, supports\ncross-platform benchmarking, and guides prioritization of security investments\nin humanoid robotics."}

By embedding the key into the gate's weighted logic and\nutilizing dynamic charge sharing, TLGLock provides a stateless and compact\nalternative to conventional locking techniques.

This paper\nsystematically analyzes the limitations of existing security tools within the\nMove ecosystem and reveals their unique vulnerability patterns. To address\nthese issues, it introduces MoveScanner, a static analysis tool based on a\ncontrol flow graph and data flow analysis architecture.

However, it exposes a new class of timing\nside-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via\nshared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate\nleakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),\nmaking them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we\nintroduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware\nKV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries\nwhile confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three\ncomponents: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates\nrule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and\ncontext-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public\nand private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and\n(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual\ninformation leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of\ntiming-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,\nSafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across\ndiverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from\n50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B.

These challenges highlight the urgent need for robust AI governance. We\npropose a comprehensive framework integrating technical and societal\ndimensions, structured around three interconnected pillars: Intrinsic Security\n(system reliability), Derivative Security (real-world harm mitigation), and\nSocial Ethics (value alignment and accountability). Uniquely, our approach\nunifies technical methods, emerging evaluation benchmarks, and policy insights\nto promote transparency, accountability, and trust in AI systems. Through a\nsystematic review of over 300 studies, we identify three core challenges: (1)\nthe generalization gap, where defenses fail against evolving threats; (2)\ninadequate evaluation protocols that overlook real-world risks; and (3)\nfragmented regulations leading to inconsistent oversight. These shortcomings\nstem from treating governance as an afterthought, rather than a foundational\ndesign principle, resulting in reactive, siloed efforts that fail to address\nthe interdependence of technical integrity and societal trust. To overcome\nthis, we present an integrated research agenda that bridges technical rigor\nwith social responsibility.

To simultaneously address these issues, we\npropose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly\nimperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead.\nOwnership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from\nan encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist\nfacts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each\ntriple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing\nunrelated knowledge.

In this paper, we develop a deep learning based intrusion detection\nsystem that is deployed in a distributed setup across devices connected to a\nnetwork. Our aim is to better equip deep learning models against unknown\nattacks using knowledge from known attacks. To this end, we develop algorithms\nto maximize the number of transferability relationships. We propose a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, along with two algorithms that\nmaximize the number of relationships observed. One is a two step data\npre-processing stage, and the other is a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA)\nalgorithm. The proposed system succeeds in achieving superior transferability\nperformance while maintaining impressive local detection rates. We also show\nthat our method is generalizable, exhibiting transferability potential across\ndatasets and even with different backbones.

While Tor encrypts traffic and hides\nIP addresses, it remains vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks such as the\nwebsite fingerprinting (WF) attack, achieving increasingly high fingerprinting\naccuracy even under open-world conditions. In response, researchers have\nproposed a variety of defenses, ranging from adaptive padding, traffic\nregularization, and traffic morphing to adversarial perturbation, that seek to\nobfuscate or reshape traffic traces. However, these defenses often entail\ntrade-offs between privacy, usability, and system performance. Despite\nextensive research, a comprehensive survey unifying WF datasets, attack\nmethodologies, and defense strategies remains absent. This paper fills that gap\nby systematically categorizing existing WF research into three key domains:\ndatasets, attack models, and defense mechanisms. We provide an in-depth\ncomparative analysis of techniques, highlight their strengths and limitations\nunder diverse threat models, and discuss emerging challenges such as multi-tab\nbrowsing and coarse-grained traffic features. By consolidating prior work and\nidentifying open research directions, this survey serves as a foundation for\nadvancing stronger privacy protection in Tor."}

While\nnumerous AI red teaming tools currently exist, practitioners face challenges in\nselecting the most appropriate tools from a rapidly expanding landscape, as\nwell as managing complex and frequently conflicting software dependencies\nacross isolated projects. Given these challenges and the relatively small\nnumber of organizations with dedicated AI red teams, there is a strong need to\nlower barriers to entry and establish a standardized environment that\nsimplifies the setup and execution of comprehensive AI model assessments.\n  Inspired by Kali Linux's role in traditional penetration testing, we\nintroduce BlackIce, an open-source containerized toolkit designed for red\nteaming Large Language Models (LLMs) and classical machine learning (ML)\nmodels. BlackIce provides a reproducible, version-pinned Docker image that\nbundles 14 carefully selected open-source tools for Responsible AI and Security\ntesting, all accessible via a unified command-line interface. With this setup,\ninitiating red team assessments is as straightforward as launching a container,\neither locally or using a cloud platform.

This highlights the\nelevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet,\njailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks,\nas they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap,\nwe propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects\nmalicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes\nharmful queries as academic research questions.

Several\nearly efforts have studied LLMs on some CTI tasks but remain limited: (i) they\nadopt only closed-book settings, relying on parametric knowledge without\nleveraging CTI knowledge bases; (ii) they cover only a narrow set of tasks,\nlacking a systematic view of the CTI landscape; and (iii) they restrict\nevaluation to single-source analysis, unlike realistic scenarios that require\nreasoning across multiple sources.

This paper proposes to\nperform steganalysis in the latent space by modeling the statistical\ndistribution of the norm of the latent vector. Specifically, we analyze the\npractical security of a scheme proposed by Hu et. al. for latent diffusion\nmodels, which is both robust and practically undetectable when steganalysis is\nperformed on generated images. We show that after embedding, the Stego (latent)\nvector is distributed on a hypersphere while the Cover vector is i.i.d.\nGaussian. By going from the image space to the latent space, we show that it is\npossible to model the norm of the vector in the latent space under the Cover or\nStego hypothesis as Gaussian distributions with different variances. A\nLikelihood Ratio Test is then derived to perform pooled steganalysis. The\nimpact of the potential knowledge of the prompt and the number of diffusion\nsteps, is also studied. Additionally, we also show how, by randomly sampling\nthe norm of the latent vector before generation, the initial Stego scheme\nbecomes undetectable in the latent space."}

Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often\nstruggle to maintain high accuracy across both frequent and rare attacks,\nleading to increased false negatives for minority classes. To address this, we\npropose a hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates specialized deep\nlearning models with an ensemble meta-classifier. Each model is trained to\ndetect a specific attack category, enabling tailored learning of class-specific\npatterns, while their collective outputs are fused by a Random Forest\nmeta-classifier to improve overall decision reliability.

In doing so, they also inherit the\nlimitations of the underlying hardware. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs),\nwhich enforce this isolation, explicitly exclude adversaries with physical\naccess from their threat model. Commercial TEEs, e.g., Intel TDX, thus assume\ninfrastructure providers do not physically exploit hardware and serve as\nsafeguards instead. This creates a tension: tenants must trust provider\nintegrity at the hardware layer, yet existing remote attestation offers no way\nto verify that CVMs actually run on physically trusted platforms, leaving\ntoday's CVM deployments unable to demonstrate that their guarantees align with\nthe TEE vendor's threat model.\n  We bridge this confidence gap with Data Center Execution Assurance (DCEA), a\ndesign generating \"Proofs of Cloud\". DCEA binds a CVM to its underlying\nplatform using vTPM-anchored measurements, ensuring CVM launch evidence and TPM\nquotes refer to the same physical chassis.\n  This takes advantage of the fact that data centers are often identifiable via\nTPMs. Our approach applies to CVMs accessing vTPMs and running on top of\nsoftware stacks fully controlled by the cloud provider, as well as\nsingle-tenant bare-metal deployments with discrete TPMs. We trust providers for\nintegrity (certificate issuance), but not for the confidentiality of\nCVM-visible state. DCEA enables remote verification of a CVM's platform origin\nand integrity, mitigating attacks like replay and attestation proxying. We\ninclude a candidate implementation on Google Cloud and Intel TDX that leverages\nIntel TXT for trusted launch. Our design refines CVMs' threat model and\nprovides a practical path for deploying high-assurance, confidential workloads\nin minimally trusted environments."}

Achieving this requires strong performance\nisolation to ensure that one container's RDMA workload does not degrade the\nperformance of others, thereby maintaining critical security assurances.\nHowever, existing isolation techniques are difficult to apply effectively due\nto the complexity of microarchitectural resource management within RDMA NICs\n(RNICs). This paper experimentally analyzes two types of resource exhaustion\nattacks on NVIDIA BlueField-3: (i) state saturation attacks and (ii) pipeline\nsaturation attacks. Our results show that state saturation attacks can cause up\nto a 93.9% loss in bandwidth, a 1,117x increase in latency, and a 115% rise in\ncache misses for victim containers, while pipeline saturation attacks lead to\nsevere link-level congestion and significant amplification, where small verb\nrequests result in disproportionately high resource consumption.

Promotion abuse is one of the fastest-growing types of fraud in\nrecent years and is characterized by users exploiting promotional activities to\ngain financial benefits from the platform. To investigate this issue, we\nconduct the first study on promotion abuse fraud in e-commerce platforms\nMEITUAN. We find that promotion abuse fraud is a group-based fraudulent\nactivity with two types of fraudulent activities: Stocking Up and Cashback\nAbuse. Unlike traditional fraudulent activities such as fake reviews, promotion\nabuse fraud typically involves ordinary customers conducting legitimate\ntransactions and these two types of fraudulent activities are often\nintertwined. To address this issue, we propose leveraging additional\ninformation from the spatial and temporal perspectives to detect promotion\nabuse fraud. In this paper, we introduce PROMOGUARDIAN, a novel multi-relation\nfused graph neural network that integrates the spatial and temporal information\nof transaction data into a homogeneous graph to detect promotion abuse fraud.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on real-world data from MEITUAN, and the\nresults demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in promotion abuse fraud detection, achieving 93.15% precision,\ndetecting 2.1 to 5.0 times more fraudsters, and preventing 1.5 to 8.8 times\nmore financial losses in production environments."}

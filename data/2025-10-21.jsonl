We present\nHierarchical Multi-Modal Threat Intelligence Fusion (HM-TIF), a framework\nexplicitly designed for this realistic scenario where naturally aligned\nmulti-modal attack data does not exist. Unlike prior work that assumes or\ncreates artificial alignment, we develop principled methods for correlating\nindependent security data streams while maintaining operational validity. Our\narchitecture employs hierarchical cross-attention with dynamic weighting that\nadapts to data availability and threat context, coupled with a novel temporal\ncorrelation protocol that preserves statistical independence. Evaluation on\nUNSW-NB15, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and CICBell-DNS2021 datasets demonstrates that\nHM-TIF achieves 88.7% accuracy with a critical 32% reduction in false positive\nrates, even without true multi-modal training data. The framework maintains\nrobustness when modalities are missing, making it immediately deployable in\nreal security operations where data streams frequently have gaps.

We present Verifiable Fine Tuning, a\nprotocol and system that produces succinct zero knowledge proofs that a\nreleased model was obtained from a public initialization under a declared\ntraining program and an auditable dataset commitment. The approach combines\nfive elements. First, commitments that bind data sources, preprocessing,\nlicenses, and per epoch quota counters to a manifest. Second, a verifiable\nsampler that supports public replayable and private index hiding batch\nselection. Third, update circuits restricted to parameter efficient fine tuning\nthat enforce AdamW style optimizer semantics and proof friendly approximations\nwith explicit error budgets. Fourth, recursive aggregation that folds per step\nproofs into per epoch and end to end certificates with millisecond\nverification. Fifth, provenance binding and optional trusted execution property\ncards that attest code identity and constants. On English and bilingual\ninstruction mixtures, the method maintains utility within tight budgets while\nachieving practical proof performance. Policy quotas are enforced with zero\nviolations, and private sampling windows show no measurable index leakage.\nFederated experiments demonstrate that the system composes with probabilistic\naudits and bandwidth constraints.

Examples of target properties $T$ include the\nbinary flag that triggers an LLM's harmful response or rejection, and the\ndegree to which information deleted by unlearning can be restored, both\nelicited via adversarial instructions. The LLM reveals an \\emph{observable\nsignal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response\ncontaining answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of\ninformation leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled\nguidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this\ngap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information\ncan be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods\ncome to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between\nthe observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query,\nwe show that achieving error $\\varepsilon$ requires at least\n$\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak\nrate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy.

Linear Logic (LL), for instance, models\nassumptions that must be used exactly once, providing a natural framework for\ntracking computational resources such as time, memory, or data access. This\ndual perspective makes linearity essential to programming languages, type\nsystems, and formal models that express both computational complexity and\ncomposability. Bridging these interpretations enables rigorous yet practical\nmethodologies for analyzing and verifying complex systems.\n  This thesis explores the use of LL to model programming paradigms based on\nlinearity. It comprises two parts: ADLL and CryptoBLL. The former applies LL to\nAutomatic Differentiation (AD), modeling linear functions over the reals and\nthe transposition operation. The latter uses LL to express complexity\nconstraints on adversaries in computational cryptography.\n  In AD, two main approaches use linear type systems: a theoretical one\ngrounded in proof theory, and a practical one implemented in JAX, a Python\nlibrary developed by Google for machine learning research. In contrast,\nframeworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow support AD without linear types. ADLL\naims to bridge theory and practice by connecting JAX's type system to LL.\n  In modern cryptography, several calculi aim to model cryptographic proofs\nwithin the computational paradigm.

Exploratory taxonomy\nanalysis suggests potential patterns in vulnerability exploitation, though\nlimited sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions. This study provides the\nfirst controlled empirical evidence challenging claims of AI attacker\nadvantage, demonstrating that defensive effectiveness critically depends on\nsuccess criteria, a nuance absent from conceptual analyses but essential for\ndeployment. These findings underscore the urgency for defenders to adopt\nopen-source Cybersecurity AI frameworks to maintain security equilibrium\nagainst accelerating offensive automation."}

Rather than\nsharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train\nthe global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy\nguarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy\nleakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the\ntraining data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion\nAttacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to\nreconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using\noptimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually\nreconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be\nenhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update\nInversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion\nmodels as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE\ncan be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely\nadopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach\nin two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets.\nOur results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe-\nart GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple\nmetrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity,\nas measured by the DreamSim metric."}

Such joint-modal\nthreats are difficult to detect and remain underexplored, largely due to the\nscarcity of high-quality implicit data. We propose ImpForge, an automated\nred-teaming pipeline that leverages reinforcement learning with tailored reward\nmodules to generate diverse implicit samples across 14 domains. Building on\nthis dataset, we further develop CrossGuard, an intent-aware safeguard\nproviding robust and comprehensive defense against both explicit and implicit\nthreats. Extensive experiments across safe and unsafe benchmarks, implicit and\nexplicit attacks, and multiple out-of-domain settings demonstrate that\nCrossGuard significantly outperforms existing defenses, including advanced\nMLLMs and guardrails, achieving stronger security while maintaining high\nutility. This offers a balanced and practical solution for enhancing MLLM\nrobustness against real-world multimodal threats."}

Existing multimodal red-teaming methods largely rely on\nbrittle templates, focus on single-attack settings, and expose only a narrow\nsubset of vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a\nvariational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as\nlearning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts. This\nprobabilistic view enables the generation of stealthy, coupled adversarial\ninputs that bypass model guardrails. We train a lightweight attacker to\napproximate the posterior, allowing efficient sampling of diverse jailbreaks\nand providing distributional insights into vulnerabilities. VERA-V further\nintegrates three complementary strategies: (i) typography-based text prompts\nthat embed harmful cues, (ii) diffusion-based image synthesis that introduces\nadversarial signals, and (iii) structured distractors to fragment VLM\nattention. Experiments on HarmBench and HADES benchmarks show that VERA-V\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both open-source and\nfrontier VLMs, achieving up to 53.75% higher attack success rate (ASR) over the\nbest baseline on GPT-4o."}

We introduce TrojanGYM, an agentic, LLM-driven framework that automatically curates HT insertions to expose detector blind spots while preserving design correctness. Given high-level HT specifications, a suite of cooperating LLM agents (instantiated with GPT-4, LLaMA-3.3-70B, and Gemini-2.5Pro) proposes and refines RTL modifications that realize diverse triggers and payloads without impacting normal functionality. TrojanGYM implements a feedback-driven benchmark generation loop co-designed with HT detectors, in which constraint-aware syntactic checking and GNN-based HT detectors provide feedback that iteratively refines HT specifications and insertion strategies to better surface detector blind spots. We further propose Robust-GNN4TJ, a new implementation of the GNN4TJ with improved graph extraction, training robustness, and prediction reliability, especially on LLM-generated HT designs. On the most challenging TrojanGYM-generated benchmarks, Robust-GNN4TJ raises HT detection rates from 0% to 60% relative to a prior GNN-based detector. We instantiate TrojanGYM on SRAM, AES-128, and UART designs at RTL level, and show that it systematically produces diverse, functionally correct HTs that reach up to 83.33% evasion rates against modern GNN-based detectors, revealing robustness gaps that are not apparent when these detectors are evaluated solely on existing TrustHub-style benchmarks. Post peer-review, we will release all codes and artifacts."}

These shifts raise urgent questions about when AI systems introduce unacceptable or intolerable cyber risk, and how risk thresholds should be identified before harms materialize at scale. In recent years, industry, government, and civil society actors have begun to articulate such thresholds for advanced AI systems, with the goal of signaling when models meaningfully amplify cyber threats, for example, by automating multi-stage intrusions, enabling zero-day discovery, or lowering the expertise required for sophisticated attacks. However, current approaches to determine these thresholds remain fragmented and limited. Many thresholds rely solely on capability benchmarks or narrow threat scenarios, and are weakly connected to empirical evidence. This paper proposes a structured approach to developing and evaluating AI cyber risk thresholds that is probabilistic, evidence-based, and operationalizable. In this paper we make three core contributions that build on our prior work that highlights the limitations of relying solely on capability assessments. First, we analyze existing industry cyber thresholds and identify common threshold elements as well as recurring methodological shortcomings. Second, we propose the use of Bayesian networks as a tool for modeling AI-enabled cyber risk, enabling the integration of heterogeneous evidence, explicit representation of uncertainty, and continuous updating as new information emerges. Third, we illustrate this approach through a focused case study on AI-augmented phishing, demonstrating how qualitative threat insights can be decomposed into measurable variables and recombined into structured risk estimates that better capture how AI changes attacker behavior and outcomes."}

We demonstrate that this class of defenses is insecure against two practical attack classes: the copy-type attack, in which a human transcribes LLM-generated text producing authentic motor signals, and timing-forgery attacks, in which automated agents sample inter-keystroke intervals from empirical human distributions. Using 13,000 sessions from the SBU corpus and three timing-forgery variants (histogram sampling, statistical impersonation, and generative LSTM), we show all attacks achieve $\\ge$99.8% evasion rates against five classifiers. While detectors achieve AUC=1.000 against fully-automated injection, they classify $\\ge$99.8% of attack samples as human with mean confidence $\\ge$0.993. We formalize a non-identifiability result: when the detector observes only timing, the mutual information between features and content provenance is zero for copy-type attacks. Although composition and transcription produce statistically distinguishable motor patterns (Cohen's d=1.28), both yield $δ$ values 2-4x above detection thresholds, rendering the distinction security-irrelevant. These systems confirm a human operated the keyboard, but not whether that human originated the text. Securing provenance requires architectures that bind the writing process to semantic content."}

Although federated learning (FL) is widely regarded as a privacy-aware training paradigm due to its decentralized nature, recent evidence shows that the final global model can still leak sensitive membership information through black-box access. In this paper, we introduce Res-MIA, a novel training-free and black-box membership inference attack that exploits the sensitivity of deep models to high-frequency input details. Res-MIA progressively degrades the input resolution using controlled downsampling and restoration operations, and analyzes the resulting confidence decay in the model's predictions. Our key insight is that training samples exhibit a significantly steeper confidence decline under resolution erosion compared to non-member samples, revealing a robust membership signal. Res-MIA requires no shadow models, no auxiliary data, and only a limited number of forward queries to the target model. We evaluate the proposed attack on a federated ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10, where it consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines and achieves an AUC of up to 0.88 with minimal computational overhead. These findings highlight frequency-sensitive overfitting as an important and previously underexplored source of privacy leakage in federated learning, and emphasize the need for privacy-aware model designs that reduce reliance on fine-grained, non-robust input features."}

These marketplaces often assert ownership over prompts, claiming them as intellectual property. This paper investigates whether concealed prompts sold on prompt marketplaces can be considered bona fide intellectual property, given that humans and AI tools may be able to infer the prompts based on publicly advertised sample images accompanying each prompt on sale. Specifically, our study aims to assess (i) how accurately humans can infer the original prompt solely by examining an AI-generated image, with the goal of generating images similar to the original image, and (ii) the possibility of improving upon individual human and AI prompt inferences by crafting combined human and AI prompts with the help of a large language model. Although previous research has explored AI-driven prompt inference and protection strategies, our work is the first to incorporate a human subject study and examine collaborative human-AI prompt inference in depth. Our findings indicate that while prompts inferred by humans and prompts inferred through a combined human and AI effort can generate images with a moderate level of similarity, they are not as successful as using the original prompt. Moreover, combining human- and AI-inferred prompts using our suggested merging techniques did not improve performance over purely human-inferred prompts."}

PatchIsland employs an ensemble of diverse LLM agents. By leveraging multiple LLM agents, PatchIsland can cover a wider range of settings (e.g., different projects, bug types, and programming languages) and also improve operational robustness. In addition, PatchIsland utilizes a two-phase patch-based deduplication to mitigate duplicate crashes and patches, which can be problematic in continuous fuzzing.\n  In our internal evaluation, PatchIsland repaired 84 of 92 vulnerabilities, demonstrating strong repair capability.

Although the ideal security notion for FE (simulation security) has been shown to be impossible in the classical setting, those impossibility results rely on inherently classical arguments. This leaves open the question of whether simulation-secure functional encryption can be achieved in the quantum regime.\n  In this work, we rule out this possibility by showing that the classical impossibility results largely extend to the quantum world. In particular, when the adversary can issue an unbounded number of challenge messages, we prove an unconditional impossibility, matching the classical barrier. In the case where the adversary may obtain many functional keys, classical arguments only yield impossibility under the assumption of pseudorandom functions; we strengthen this by proving impossibility under the potentially weaker assumption of pseudorandom quantum states. In the same setting, we also establish an alternative impossibility based on public-key encryption. Since public-key encryption is not known to imply pseudorandom quantum states, this provides independent evidence of the barrier. As part of our proofs, we show a novel incompressibility property for pseudorandom states, which may be of independent interest."}

By freezing the backbone and training only compact low-rank adapters, these methods appear to limit gradient leakage and thwart existing Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs).\n  Contrary to this assumption, we show that low-rank adapters create new, exploitable leakage channels. We propose the Unordered-word-bag-based Text Reconstruction (UTR) attack, a novel GIA tailored to the unique structure of adapter-based FedLLMs. UTR overcomes three core challenges: low-dimensional gradients, frozen backbones, and combinatorially large reconstruction spaces by: (i) inferring token presence from attention patterns in frozen layers, (ii) performing sentence-level inversion within the low-rank subspace of adapter gradients, and (iii) enforcing semantic coherence through constrained greedy decoding guided by language priors. Extensive experiments across diverse models (GPT2-Large, BERT, Qwen2.5-7B) and datasets (CoLA, SST-2, Rotten Tomatoes) demonstrate that UTR achieves near-perfect reconstruction accuracy (ROUGE-1/2 > 99), even with large batch size settings where prior GIAs fail completely. Our results reveal a fundamental tension between parameter efficiency and privacy in FedLLMs, challenging the prevailing belief that lightweight adaptation inherently enhances security.

While for systems that return the similarity score, one can use attacks such as hill-climbing, for systems where the adversary can only learn whether the authentication attempt was successful, this question remained open.\n  In this paper, we show that it is indeed possible to reconstruct the biometric template by just observing the success/failure of the authentication attempt (given the ability to inject a sufficient amount of templates).

Traditional intrusion detection systems designed for static ground-based networks prove inadequate for tackling the unique characteristics of aerial IoT environments, including frequent topology changes, real-time detection requirements, and energy limitations. In this article, we analyze the intrusion detection requirements for LAE-IoT networks, complemented by a comprehensive review of evaluation metrics that cover detection effectiveness, response time, and resource consumption. Then, we investigate transformative potential of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms and introduce a large language model (LLM)-enabled agentic AI framework for enhancing intrusion detection in LAE-IoT networks. This leads to our proposal of a novel multi-agent collaborative intrusion detection framework that leverages specialized LLM-enhanced agents for intelligent data processing and adaptive classification. Through experimental validation, our framework demonstrates superior performance of over 90\\% classification accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets. These results highlight the transformative potential of combining agentic AI principles with LLMs for next-generation LAE-IoT security systems."}

Even emerging AI-based methods suffer from hallucinations, context constraints, and a heavy reliance on expensive, proprietary Large Language Models. In this paper, we introduce Heimdallr, an automated auditing agent designed to overcome these hurdles through four core innovations. By reorganizing code at the function level, Heimdallr minimizes context overhead while preserving essential business logic. It then employs heuristic reasoning to detect complex vulnerabilities and automatically chain functional exploits. Finally, a cascaded verification layer validates these findings to eliminate false positives. Notably, this approach achieves high performance on lightweight, open-source models like GPToss-120B without relying on proprietary systems. Our evaluations demonstrate exceptional performance, as Heimdallr successfully reconstructed 17 out of 20 real-world attacks post June 2025, resulting in total losses of $384M, and uncovered 4 confirmed zero-day vulnerabilities that safeguarded $400M in TVL. Compared to SOTA baselines including both official industrial tools and academic tools, Heimdallr at most reduces analysis time by 97.59% and financial costs by 98.77% while boosting detection precision by over 93.66%. Notably, when applied to auditing contests, Heimdallr can achieve a 92.45% detection rate at a negligible cost of $2.31 per 10K LOC. We provide production-ready auditing services and release valuable benchmarks for future work."}

By utilizing client-side cryptography and self-destructing server instances, we demonstrate a protocol where the server acts as a blind medium rather than a custodian of state.

FARM leverages a triplet autoencoder to project samples into a discriminative latent space, enabling unsupervised drift detection via DBSCAN clustering and dynamic thresholding. For rapid adaptation, it employs few-shot learning using prototype-based classification, requiring only a handful of labeled samples. FARM also supports full retraining when enough drifted samples accumulate, updating the latent space for long-term integration. Experiments on the BenchMFC dataset demonstrate that FARM improves classification performance under covariate drift by 5.6\\%, and achieves an average F1 score of 0.85 on unseen malware families using only few-shot adaptation, which further increases to 0.94 after retraining.

Unfortunately, subsequent work has primarily fixated on the privacy-utility tradeoff, leaving the subject of fairness constraints undervalued and under-researched. This paper provides a systematic treatment connecting three threads: (1) Dalenius's impossibility results for semantic privacy, (2) Dwork's differential privacy as an achievable alternative, and (3) emerging impossibility results from the addition of a fairness requirement. Through concrete examples and technical analysis, the three-way Pareto frontier between privacy, utility, and fairness is demonstrated to showcase the fundamental limits on what can be simultaneously achieved. In this work, these limits are characterized, the impact on minority groups is demonstrated, and practical guidance for navigating these tradeoffs are provided. This forms a unified framework synthesizing scattered results to help practitioners and policymakers make informed decisions when deploying private fair learning systems."}

This study challenges that paradigm by modeling refusal as a local decision boundary and examining its stability under structured perturbations. We evaluated two models, GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, using 3,274 perturbation runs derived from refusal-inducing prompt injection attempts. Each base prompt was subjected to 25 perturbations across five structured families, with outcomes manually coded as Refusal, Partial Compliance, or Full Compliance.\n  Using chi-square tests, logistic regression, mixed-effects modeling, and a novel Refusal Boundary Entropy (RBE) metric, we demonstrate that while both models refuse >94% of attempts, refusal instability is persistent and non-uniform. Approximately one-third of initial refusal-inducing prompts exhibited at least one \"refusal escape,\" a transition to compliance under perturbation. We find that artifact type is a stronger predictor of refusal failure than perturbation style. Textual artifacts, such as ransomware notes, exhibited significantly higher instability, with flip rates exceeding 20%. Conversely, executable malware artifacts showed zero refusal escapes in both models. While GPT-4o demonstrated tighter refusal enforcement and lower RBE than GPT-4.1, it did not eliminate artifact-dependent risks. These findings suggest that single-prompt evaluations systematically overestimate safety robustness. We conclude that refusal behavior is a probabilistic, artifact-dependent boundary phenomenon rather than a stable binary property, requiring a shift in how LLM safety is measured and audited."}

Streaming engines are highly dependent on runtime scheduling, window triggers, arrival orders, and uncertainties such as network jitters.

In this work, we introduce a blockchain-backed provenance architecture for streaming platform (e.g Kafka Streams) the publishes cryptographic data of a windowed data stream without publishing window payloads on-chain. We used real-time weather data from weather stations in Berlin. Weather records are canonicalized, deduplicated, and aggregated per window, then serialised deterministically. Furthermore, the Merkle root of the records within the window is computed and stored alongside with Kafka offsets boundaries to MultiChain blockchain streams as checkpoints. Our design can enable an independent auditor to verify: (1) the completeness of window payloads, (2) canonical serialization, and (3) correctness of derived analytics such as minimum/maximum/average temperatures. We evaluated our system using real data stream from two weather stations (Berlin-Brandenburg and Berlin-Tempelhof) and showed linear verification cost, deterministic reproducibility, and with a scalable off-chain storage with on-chain cryptographic anchoring. We also demonstrated that the blockchain can afford to be integrated with streaming platforms particularly with our system, and we get satisfactory transactions per second values."}

Although a considerable research effort has been made to automatically detect aim-assist cheats, existing works suffer from unreliable frameworks, limited generalizability, high overhead, low detection performance, and a lack of explainability of detection results. In this paper, we propose XGuardian, a server-side generalized and explainable system for detecting aim-assist cheats to overcome these limitations. It requires only two raw data inputs, pitch and yaw, which are all FPS games' must-haves, to construct novel temporal features and describe aim trajectories, which are essential for distinguishing cheaters and normal players. XGuardian is evaluated with the latest mainstream FPS game CS2, and validates its generalizability with another two different games. It achieves high detection performance and low overhead compared to prior works across different games with real-world and large-scale datasets, demonstrating wide generalizability and high effectiveness. It is able to justify its predictions and thereby shorten the ban cycle. We make XGuardian as well as our datasets publicly available."}

The computations are secured with special keys called rotation keys which often take up the majority of memory. In complex FHE applications, these rotation keys can cause a large memory bottleneck limiting program throughput. Existing compilers make little effort to solve this problem, instead relying on systems with massive memory availability. This resource requirement is a barrier to FHE uptake because optimizing FHE programs by hand is challenging due to their scale, complexity and expertise required.\n  In this work, we present KeyMemRT; an MLIR based compiler and runtime framework that individually manages rotation key lifetimes to lower memory utilization and to allow arbitrary number of rotation indices to be supported without memory bloating. KeyMemRT relies on dataflow analysis to determine key lifetimes and is the first FHE compiler to provide automatic key management, handle fine-grained key-mangement and manage boostrap keys. We implement frontends for Orion and HEIR and show improvements over state-of-the-art FHE compilers.

In this context, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) has emerged as a primary cryptographic solution to provide non-interactive confidential LLM inference. Existing solutions scale poorly with the input token length, and hence focus either on small models or larger models with a small number of input tokens. They also suffer from the existence of large outlier values. These values have a strong impact on the evaluation of non-linear layers, leading to large-degree polynomial approximation and thus heavy evaluation costs.\n  We propose an FHE-based private LLM inference solution that allows thousands of input tokens with only a part of them being encrypted: this fits with a scenario where the context is benign and only part of the input is sensitive. To do so, we suggest an unbalanced chunked prefill framework that processes the private and public parts of the input tokens differently. Our framework contains plaintext-plaintext, plaintext-ciphertext and ciphertext-ciphertext computational components. We adopt different strategies and ingredients for each component. We also devise new homomorphic algorithms for specific matrix multiplication and polynomial evaluation tasks encountered during LLM inference.\n  Furthermore, without retraining, we tailor the LLM inference algorithm to reduce the ranges of outlier values: we leverage machine learning strategies (token prepending and rotations) to mitigate the impact of the outliers on non-linear layers.\n  Based on these ingredients, we describe a CKKS-based end-to-end implementation of Llama-2-7B private inference for up to 4096 input tokens, of which the last 128 are encrypted.

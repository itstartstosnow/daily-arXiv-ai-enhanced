### [1] [Network-Aware Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04710)
*Zhou Li,Yu Zheng,Tianhao Wang,Sang-Woo Jun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了网络感知差分隐私的新方向，旨在解决网络环境与差分隐私技术结合的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前差分隐私研究主要集中在去中心化方向（如本地DP和混洗DP），但缺乏对网络通信环境下DP机制的系统性研究和专门优化。

Method: 通过识别网络安全和网络拓扑两个关键领域，探索网络研究如何为DP的设计和部署提供实质性贡献。

Result: 提出了网络感知差分隐私的研究框架，为DP在不同网络环境中的适配和优化提供了新的研究方向。

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在鼓励更多研究关注DP在各种网络环境中的部署优化，填补网络与DP交叉领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a privacy-enhancement technology (PET) that
receives prominent attention from the academia, industry, and government. One
main development over the past decade has been the decentralization of DP,
including local DP and shuffle DP. Despite that decentralized DP heavily relies
on network communications for data collection,we found that: 1) no systematic
study has surveyed the research opportunities at the intersection of networking
and DP; 2) nor have there been significant efforts to develop DP mechanisms
that are explicitly tailored for network environments. In this paper, we seek
to address this gap by initiating a new direction of network-aware DP. We
identified two focus areas where the network research can offer substantive
contributions to the design and deployment of DP, related to network security
and topology. Through this work, we hope to encourage more research that
adapt/optimize DP's deployment in various network environments.

*Xiaogang Cheng,Ren Guo,Zuxi Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 基于高阶排的椭圆曲线构建分层撤销公钥签名方案，展示了高阶排椭圆曲线在加密中的潜在价值


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排查高的椭圆曲线在敏捷性和安全性方面都优于传统RSA和有限域离散对数加密，但之前未被应用于加密方案

Method: 利用高阶排的椭圆曲线构建公钥签名方案，其中排名决定了撤销树的高度

Result: 虽然某些方面效率不高，但成功展示了高阶排椭圆曲线在加密中的重要价值

Conclusion: 高阶排椭圆曲线对加密应用具有重要价值，所提出的技术和假设可扩展到其他加密构建中

Abstract: Elliptic curve cryptography is better than traditional cryptography based on
RSA and discrete logarithm of finite field in terms of efficiency and security.
In this paper, we show how to exploit elliptic curve with high rank, which has
not been used in cryptography before, to construct cryptographic schemes.
Concretely we demonstrate how to construct public key signature scheme with
hierarchy revocation based on elliptic curve with high rank, where the rank
determines the height of the revocation tree. Although our construction is not
very efficient in some sense, our construction shows elliptic curve with high
rank is valuable and important for cryptographic usage. The technique and
assumption presented can surely be used for other cryptographic constructions.

### [3] [Adversarial Augmentation and Active Sampling for Robust Cyber Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04999)
*Sidahmed Benabderrahmane,Talal Rahwan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出结合自编码器异常检测和主动学习的新方法，用于APT检测，在数据稀缺和高度不平衡的真实场景中显著提升检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APT攻击具有隐蔽性和长期性，传统监督学习需要大量标注数据，而现实场景中标注数据稀缺且APT样本极少（仅占0.004%）

Method: 基于注意力对抗双自编码器的异常检测框架，结合主动学习循环，选择性查询不确定样本的标签来减少标注成本

Result: 在DARPA透明计算项目的真实溯源数据上测试，覆盖多种操作系统，在两种攻击场景中均显著优于现有方法，检测率大幅提升

Conclusion: 该方法能够以最少的数据有效学习，减少对大量人工标注的依赖，为APT检测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) present a considerable challenge to
cybersecurity due to their stealthy, long-duration nature. Traditional
supervised learning methods typically require large amounts of labeled data,
which is often scarce in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel
approach that combines AutoEncoders for anomaly detection with active learning
to iteratively enhance APT detection. By selectively querying an oracle for
labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, our method reduces labeling costs
while improving detection accuracy, enabling the model to effectively learn
with minimal data and reduce reliance on extensive manual labeling. We present
a comprehensive formulation of the Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based
anomaly detection framework and demonstrate how the active learning loop
progressively enhances the model's performance. The framework is evaluated on
real-world, imbalanced provenance trace data from the DARPA Transparent
Computing program, where APT-like attacks account for just 0.004\% of the data.
The datasets, which cover multiple operating systems including Android, Linux,
BSD, and Windows, are tested in two attack scenarios. The results show
substantial improvements in detection rates during active learning,
outperforming existing methods.

### [4] [From Protest to Power Plant: Interpreting the Role of Escalatory Hacktivism in Cyber Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05104)
*Richard Derbyshire,Diana Selck-Paulsson,Charl van der Walt,Joe Burton*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文分析了2022年以来黑客活动分子从DDoS攻击升级到针对关键基础设施OT系统的趋势，探讨了其作为国家代理人的角色转变及相应的政策应对策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究黑客活动分子战术升级背后的战略动机，分析国家如何容忍、鼓励或利用这些组织作为代理人，在模糊 activism、网络犯罪和国家赞助行动界限的冲突中发挥作用。

Method: 提出了一种基于行动影响、对国家意识形态的契合度以及东道国参与程度来解读黑客活动分子的新方法，为理解这一现象提供了结构化分析框架。

Result: 揭示了黑客活动分子从抗议活动向类似网络战争行为的转变趋势，明确了其对国际安全稳定的威胁，并建立了分类评估体系。

Conclusion: 需要制定针对性的政策和安全策略来应对这一不断演变的威胁，为网络安全政策、治理以及非国家网络行为体与国家利益日益交织的讨论做出贡献。

Abstract: Since 2022, hacktivist groups have escalated their tactics, expanding from
distributed denial-of-service attacks and document leaks to include targeting
operational technology (OT). By 2024, attacks on the OT of critical national
infrastructure (CNI) had been linked to partisan hacktivist efforts in ongoing
geopolitical conflicts, demonstrating a shift from protest to something more
resembling cyber warfare. This escalation raises critical questions about the
classification of these groups and the appropriate state response to their
growing role in destabilizing international security.
  This paper examines the strategic motivations behind escalatory hacktivism,
highlighting how states may tolerate, encourage, or leverage hacktivist groups
as proxies in conflicts that blur the lines between activism, cybercrime, and
state-sponsored operations. We introduce a novel method for interpreting
hacktivists based on the impact of their actions, alignment to state ideology,
and host state involvement, offering a structured approach to understanding the
phenomenon. Finally, we assess policy and security implications, particularly
for host and victim states, and propose strategies to address this evolving
threat. By doing so, this paper contributes to international discussions on
cyber security policy, governance, and the increasing intersection between
non-state cyber actors and state interests.

### [5] [Odoo-based Subcontract Inter-site Access Control Mechanism for Construction Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05149)
*Huy Hung Ho,Nhan Le Thanh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 开发了一个集成到Odoo ERP框架中的劳动力管理子系统，采用模块化架构来简化劳动力管理、任务跟踪和审批流程，支持智能建筑管理中的弹性劳动力模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Construction 4.0时代下，建筑行业采用智能灵活的 outsourcing 和分包策略，但面临层次集成管理和跨场地协作协调的挑战，需要新的管理系统来支持弹性劳动力模式。

Method: 采用三管齐下的方法：混合访问控制、第三方集成实现跨域通信、基于角色的跨场地映射算法；使用树状索引结构和拉格朗日插值法提高角色映射效率；通过统一的属性映射中心支持不同程度的定制化。

Result: 系统在高用户量和离线条件下表现出鲁棒性；实验结果显示数据库性能和工作流适应性得到改善，支持可扩展的企业级解决方案。

Conclusion: 该系统能够满足智能建筑管理不断发展的需求，为建筑行业提供了有效的弹性劳动力管理解决方案，支持动态扩展的劳动力模型和跨组织协作。

Abstract: In the era of Construction 4.0, the industry is embracing a new paradigm of
labor elasticity, driven by smart and flexible outsourcing and subcontracting
strategies. The increased reliance on specialized subcontractors enables
companies to scale labor dynamically based on project demands. This adaptable
workforce model presents challenges in managing hierarchical integration and
coordinating inter-site collaboration. Our design introduces a subsystem
integrated into the Odoo ERP framework, employing a modular architecture to
streamline labor management, task tracking, and approval workflows. The system
adopts a three-pronged approach to ensure synchronized data exchange between
general contractors and subcontractors, while maintaining both security and
operational independence. The system features hybrid access control,
third-party integration for cross-domain communication, and role-based mapping
algorithm across sites. The system supports varying degrees of customization
through a unified and consolidated attribute mapping center. This center
leverages a tree-like index structure and Lagrange interpolation method to
enhance the efficiency of role mapping. Demonstrations highlight practical
application in outsourcing, integration, and scalability scenarios, confirming
the system's robustness under high user volumes and in offline conditions.
Experimental results further show improvements in database performance and
workflow adaptability to support a scalable, enterprise-level solution that
aligns with the evolving demands of smart construction management.

### [6] [Reinforcing Secure Live Migration through Verifiable State Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05150)
*Stefanos Vasileaidis,Thanassis Giannetsos,Matthias Schunter,Bruno Crispo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TALOS是一个轻量级框架，用于可信应用程序在TEE环境中的可验证状态管理和可信迁移，解决了安全状态保存、完整性验证等挑战，支持跨不同TEE架构的移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代分布式系统中需要支持可信应用程序在TEE环境中的实时迁移，但面临安全状态保存、完整性验证、防重放和防回滚、防止未授权克隆等独特挑战。

Method: 基于最小化信任假设原则，将TA视为不可信直到明确验证，不依赖可信第三方。集成内存自省和控制流图提取技术，确保迁移应用的完整性和安全启动。

Result: 实现了强安全保证同时保持效率，适用于去中心化环境，支持Intel SGX和RISC-V Keystone等多种TEE架构，证明了框架的可移植性。

Conclusion: TALOS框架为可信应用程序迁移提供了有效的解决方案，在保持安全性的同时实现了跨TEE架构的可移植性，适用于现代网络服务网格中的协同计算需求。

Abstract: Live migration of applications is a fundamental capability for enabling
resilient computing in modern distributed systems. However, extending this
functionality to trusted applications (TA) -- executing within Trusted
Execution Environments (TEEs) -- introduces unique challenges such as secure
state preservation, integrity verification, replay and rollback prevention, and
mitigation of unauthorized cloning of TAs. We present TALOS, a lightweight
framework for verifiable state management and trustworthy application
migration. While our implementation is prototyped and evaluated using Intel SGX
with the Gramine LibOS and RISC-V Keystone (evidencing the framework's
portability across diverse TEEs), its design is agnostic to the underlying TEE
architecture. Such agility is a necessity in today's network service mesh
(collaborative computing across the continuum) where application workloads must
be managed across domain boundaries in a harmonized fashion. TALOS is built
around the principle of minimizing trust assumptions: TAs are treated as
untrusted until explicitly verified, and the migration process does not rely on
a trusted third party. To ensure both the integrity and secure launch of the
migrated application, TALOS integrates memory introspection and control-flow
graph extraction, enabling robust verification of state continuity and
execution flow. Thereby achieving strong security guarantees while maintaining
efficiency, making it suitable for decentralized settings.

### [7] [Jamming Smarter, Not Harder: Exploiting O-RAN Y1 RAN Analytics for Efficient Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05161)
*Abiodun Ganiyu,Dara Ron,Syed Rafiul Hussain,Vijay K Shah*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文展示了O-RAN中Y1接口的安全漏洞，攻击者可通过监控下行链路指标发起选择性干扰攻击，提出了两种基于Y1的干扰策略并在真实测试床上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN的Y1接口虽然增强了网络可见性和优化能力，但也带来了安全风险——恶意Y1消费者可能滥用分析信息进行针对性干扰攻击。

Method: 提出了两种Y1辅助干扰策略：基于DBSCAN聚类的干扰器和基于阈值的干扰器，并在空中LTE/5G O-RAN测试床上与持续干扰和随机干扰基准策略进行比较。

Result: 在无约束干扰预算下，阈值干扰器可接近持续干扰的破坏效果同时减少27%传输时间；在约束预算下，聚类干扰器最有效，可造成18.1%比特率下降而仅活跃25%时间。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了干扰隐蔽性与效率之间的关键权衡，表明Y1接口暴露RAN分析信息可能实现高度针对性、低开销的攻击，对民用和关键任务O-RAN部署提出了重要安全考虑。

Abstract: The Y1 interface in O-RAN enables the sharing of RAN Analytics Information
(RAI) between the near-RT RIC and authorized Y1 consumers, which may be
internal applications within the operator's trusted domain or external systems
accessing data through a secure exposure function. While this visibility
enhances network optimization and enables advanced services, it also introduces
a potential security risk -- a malicious or compromised Y1 consumer could
misuse analytics to facilitate targeted interference. In this work, we
demonstrate how an adversary can exploit the Y1 interface to launch selective
jamming attacks by passively monitoring downlink metrics. We propose and
evaluate two Y1-aided jamming strategies: a clustering-based jammer leveraging
DBSCAN for traffic profiling and a threshold-based jammer. These are compared
against two baselines strategies -- always-on jammer and random jammer -- on an
over-the-air LTE/5G O-RAN testbed. Experimental results show that in
unconstrained jamming budget scenarios, the threshold-based jammer can closely
replicate the disruption caused by always-on jamming while reducing
transmission time by 27\%. Under constrained jamming budgets, the
clustering-based jammer proves most effective, causing up to an 18.1\% bitrate
drop while remaining active only 25\% of the time. These findings reveal a
critical trade-off between jamming stealthiness and efficiency, and illustrate
how exposure of RAN analytics via the Y1 interface can enable highly targeted,
low-overhead attacks, raising important security considerations for both
civilian and mission-critical O-RAN deployments.

### [8] [Verifiability and Privacy in Federated Learning through Context-Hiding Multi-Key Homomorphic Authenticators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05162)
*Simone Bottoni,Giulio Zizzo,Stefano Braghin,Alberto Trombetta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种可验证的联邦学习协议，使客户端能够验证聚合器计算的正确性而不泄露更新内容，使用安全聚合和线性同态认证方案来检测恶意聚合器操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中聚合器可能恶意行为（如偏置模型或篡改权重），现有研究主要关注恶意客户端，但对恶意聚合器的防护不足。

Method: 结合标准安全聚合技术保护个体模型更新，使用线性同态认证方案实现高效、隐私保护的聚合结果验证。

Result: 协议能够检测聚合器的操纵行为，同时保持较低的计算开销，可扩展到具有数百万参数的大型神经网络。

Conclusion: 该工作为联邦学习提供了针对恶意聚合器的有效防护机制，在保护隐私的同时确保了计算结果的正确性验证。

Abstract: Federated Learning has rapidly expanded from its original inception to now
have a large body of research, several frameworks, and sold in a variety of
commercial offerings. Thus, its security and robustness is of significant
importance. There are many algorithms that provide robustness in the case of
malicious clients. However, the aggregator itself may behave maliciously, for
example, by biasing the model or tampering with the weights to weaken the
models privacy. In this work, we introduce a verifiable federated learning
protocol that enables clients to verify the correctness of the aggregators
computation without compromising the confidentiality of their updates. Our
protocol uses a standard secure aggregation technique to protect individual
model updates with a linearly homomorphic authenticator scheme that enables
efficient, privacy-preserving verification of the aggregated result. Our
construction ensures that clients can detect manipulation by the aggregator
while maintaining low computational overhead. We demonstrate that our approach
scales to large models, enabling verification over large neural networks with
millions of parameters.

### [9] [On Hyperparameters and Backdoor-Resistance in Horizontal Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05192)
*Simon Lachnit,Ghassan Karame*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 水平联邦学习中的训练超参数选择对后门攻击和防御效果有重大影响，适当调整可显著控制攻击效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习安全研究常忽视良性客户端超参数选择对后门攻击效果的重要影响，导致攻击效果被高估或低估防御效果

Method: 通过理论分析和实验测量，研究了学习率、批处理大小、本地迭代次数等超参数对后门攻击效果的影响

Result: 适当调整良性客户端超参数可显著控制后门攻击效果，如将A3FL攻击的50%存活期减少98.6%，主任务准确率仅下降2.9%百分点

Conclusion: 在水平联邦学习安全研究中，应重视良性客户端超参数选择，适当调整可在不使用任何防御措施的情况下显著提升模型安全性

Abstract: Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) is particularly vulnerable to backdoor
attacks as adversaries can easily manipulate both the training data and
processes to execute sophisticated attacks. In this work, we study the impact
of training hyperparameters on the effectiveness of backdoor attacks and
defenses in HFL. More specifically, we show both analytically and by means of
measurements that the choice of hyperparameters by benign clients does not only
influence model accuracy but also significantly impacts backdoor attack
success. This stands in sharp contrast with the multitude of contributions in
the area of HFL security, which often rely on custom ad-hoc hyperparameter
choices for benign clients$\unicode{x2013}$leading to more pronounced backdoor
attack strength and diminished impact of defenses. Our results indicate that
properly tuning benign clients' hyperparameters$\unicode{x2013}$such as
learning rate, batch size, and number of local epochs$\unicode{x2013}$can
significantly curb the effectiveness of backdoor attacks, regardless of the
malicious clients' settings. We support this claim with an extensive robustness
evaluation of state-of-the-art attack-defense combinations, showing that
carefully chosen hyperparameters yield across-the-board improvements in
robustness without sacrificing main task accuracy. For example, we show that
the 50%-lifespan of the strong A3FL attack can be reduced by 98.6%,
respectively$\unicode{x2013}$all without using any defense and while incurring
only a 2.9 percentage points drop in clean task accuracy.

### [10] [On Evaluating the Poisoning Robustness of Federated Learning under Local Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05265)
*Zijian Wang,Wei Tong,Tingxuan Han,Haoyu Chen,Tianling Zhang,Yunlong Mao,Sheng Zhong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于局部差分隐私联邦学习的新题模型毒化攻击框架，能够在遵守隐私约束的前提下最大化全局训练损失，并避免多种防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习与局部差分隐私结合虽能保护隐私，但分布式数据管理使其容易受到恶意参与者的模型毒化攻击。当前对LDPFL协议在模型毒化攻击下的稳健性研究不充分。

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的模型毒化攻击框架，通过在逆向训练过程中嵌入精心设计的约束来避免Multi-Krum和修剪均值等防御机制。

Result: 在三种代表性LDPFL协议、三个标准数据集和两类深度神经网络上评估，定制攻击显著降低了全局模型性能，揭示了关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LDPFL对模型毒化攻击的敏感性，强调了开发更稳健的防御策略的必要性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) combined with local differential privacy (LDP)
enables privacy-preserving model training across decentralized data sources.
However, the decentralized data-management paradigm leaves LDPFL vulnerable to
participants with malicious intent. The robustness of LDPFL protocols,
particularly against model poisoning attacks (MPA), where adversaries inject
malicious updates to disrupt global model convergence, remains insufficiently
studied. In this paper, we propose a novel and extensible model poisoning
attack framework tailored for LDPFL settings. Our approach is driven by the
objective of maximizing the global training loss while adhering to local
privacy constraints. To counter robust aggregation mechanisms such as
Multi-Krum and trimmed mean, we develop adaptive attacks that embed carefully
crafted constraints into a reverse training process, enabling evasion of these
defenses. We evaluate our framework across three representative LDPFL
protocols, three benchmark datasets, and two types of deep neural networks.
Additionally, we investigate the influence of data heterogeneity and privacy
budgets on attack effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that our
adaptive attacks can significantly degrade the performance of the global model,
revealing critical vulnerabilities and highlighting the need for more robust
LDPFL defense strategies against MPA. Our code is available at

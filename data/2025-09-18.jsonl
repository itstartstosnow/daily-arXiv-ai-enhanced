Applying DP requires making several\nimplementation decisions, each with significant impacts on data privacy and/or\nutility. Hence, to promote shared learning and accountability around DP\ndeployments, Dwork, Kohli, and Mulligan (2019) proposed a public-facing\nrepository (\"registry\") of DP deployments. The DP community has recently\nstarted to work toward realizing this vision. We contribute to this effort by\n(1) developing a holistic, hierarchical schema to describe any given DP\ndeployment and (2) designing and implementing an interactive interface to act\nas a registry where practitioners can access information about past DP\ndeployments. We (3) populate our interface with 21 real-world DP deployments\nand (4) conduct an exploratory user study with DP practitioners ($n=16$) to\nunderstand how they would use the registry, as well as what challenges and\nopportunities they foresee around its adoption. We find that participants were\nenthusiastic about the registry as a valuable resource for evaluating prior\ndeployments and making future deployments. They also identified several\nopportunities for the registry, including that it can become a \"hub\" for the\ncommunity and support broader communication around DP (e.g., to legal teams).\nAt the same time, they identified challenges around the registry gaining\nadoption, including the effort and risk involved with making implementation\nchoices public and moderating the quality of entries.

We demonstrate that audio signals can\ninduce subtle surface vibrations detectable by a mouse's optical sensor.\nRemarkably, user-space software on popular operating systems can collect and\nbroadcast this sensitive side channel, granting attackers access to raw mouse\ndata without requiring direct system-level permissions.

Unfortunately,\ncurrent approaches for evaluating the security of these embedded network stacks\nrequire manual effort or access to hardware, and they generally focus only on\nsmall parts of the embedded system. A promising alternative is firmware\nrehosting, which enables fuzz testing of the entire firmware by generically\nemulating the physical hardware.

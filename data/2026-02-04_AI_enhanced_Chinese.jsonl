However, the robustness of such systems against adversarial attack remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we study adversarial claim attacks against search-enabled LLM-based fact-checking systems under a realistic input-only threat model. We propose DECEIVE-AFC, an agent-based adversarial attack framework that integrates novel claim-level attack strategies and adversarial claim validity evaluation principles. DECEIVE-AFC systematically explores adversarial attack trajectories that disrupt search behavior, evidence retrieval, and LLM-based reasoning without relying on access to evidence sources or model internals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets and real-world systems demonstrate that our attacks substantially degrade verification performance, reducing accuracy from 78.7% to 53.7%, and significantly outperform existing claim-based attack baselines with strong cross-system transferability.", "AI": {"tldr": "DECEIVE-AFC\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684LLM\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u6270\u641c\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u4ec5\u8f93\u5165\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDECEIVE-AFC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u7ea7\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u58f0\u660e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u5e72\u6270\u641c\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u548cLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8f68\u8ff9", "result": "\u653b\u51fb\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece78.7%\u964d\u81f353.7%\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u58f0\u660e\u7ea7\u653b\u51fb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684LLM\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0cDECEIVE-AFC\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003"}}

Building sophisticated exploits requires deep expertise and manual effort, leading defenders to assume adversaries cannot afford tailored attacks at scale. AI agents break this balance by automating vulnerability discovery and exploitation across thousands of targets, needing only small success rates to remain profitable. Current developers focus on preventing misuse through data filtering, safety alignment, and output guardrails. Such protections fail against adversaries who control open-weight models, bypass safety controls, or develop offensive capabilities independently. We argue that AI-agent-driven cyber attacks are inevitable, requiring a fundamental shift in defensive strategy. In this position paper, we identify why existing defenses cannot stop adaptive adversaries and demonstrate that defenders must develop offensive security intelligence. We propose three actions for building frontier offensive AI capabilities responsibly. First, construct comprehensive benchmarks covering the full attack lifecycle. Second, advance from workflow-based to trained agents for discovering in-wild vulnerabilities at scale. Third, implement governance restricting offensive agents to audited cyber ranges, staging release by capability tier, and distilling findings into safe defensive-only agents. We strongly recommend treating offensive AI capabilities as essential defensive infrastructure, as containing cybersecurity risks requires mastering them in controlled settings before adversaries do.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c06\u5f7b\u5e95\u6539\u53d8\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u653b\u9632\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u65e0\u6cd5\u963b\u6b62\u8fd9\u79cd\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u8f6c\u53d8\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6027AI\u80fd\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\u9632\u5fa1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6765\u5efa\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u6765\u9650\u5236\u653b\u51fb\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u62a4\u680f\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u963b\u6b62\u63a7\u5236\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\u3002\u653b\u51fb\u6027AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u884c\u52a8\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u8986\u76d6\u5b8c\u6574\u653b\u51fb\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b2\uff09\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53d1\u73b0\u91ce\u5916\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1b3\uff09\u5b9e\u65bd\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9650\u5236\u5728\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u9776\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u6309\u80fd\u529b\u5c42\u7ea7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u4ec5\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u65e0\u6cd5\u963b\u6b62\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5bf9\u624b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6027AI\u80fd\u529b\u89c6\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u638c\u63e1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5373\u5c06\u5230\u6765\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u5fc5\u987b\u8fdb\u884c\u6839\u672c\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6027AI\u80fd\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u9632\u5fa1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6765\u5efa\u8bbe\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u638c\u63e1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u653b\u51fb\u6027AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\u3002"}}

Similar to the initial wave of digital audio-visual content at the turn of the millennium, the demand for intellectual property protection is also increasing, since explicit and editable 3D parameterization makes unauthorized use and dissemination easier. In this position paper, we argue that effective progress in watermarking 3D assets requires articulated security objectives and realistic threat models, incorporating the lessons learned from digital audio-visual asset protection over the past decades. To address this gap in security specification and evaluation, we advocate a scenario-driven formulation, in which adversarial capabilities are formalized through a security model. Based on this formulation, we construct a reference framework that organizes existing methods and clarifies how specific design choices map to corresponding adversarial assumptions. Within this framework, we also examine a legacy spread-spectrum embedding scheme, characterizing its advantages and limitations and highlighting the important trade-offs it entails.

Although the ethical principles of consent - providing information, ensuring comprehension, and ensuring voluntariness - are well-defined, the technological infrastructure remains outdated. Clinicians are responsible for obtaining informed consent from research subjects or patients, and for managing it before, during, and after clinical trials or care, which is a burden for them. The voluntary nature of participating in clinical research or undergoing medical treatment implies the need for a participant-centric consent management system. However, this is not reflected in most established systems. Not only do most healthcare information systems not follow a user-centric model, but they also create data silos, which significantly reduce the mobility of patient data between different healthcare institutions and impact personalized medicine. Furthermore, consent management tools are outdated. We propose ClinConNet (Clinical Consent Network), a platform that connects researchers and participants based on clinical research projects. ClinConNet is powered by a dynamic consent model based on blockchain and take advantage of dynamic consent interfaces, as well as blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity systems.

This paper proposes TinyGuard, a lightweight Byzantine defense that augments the standard FedAvg algorithm via statistical update f ingerprinting. Instead of operating directly on high-dimensional gradients, TinyGuard extracts compact statistical fingerprints cap turing key behavioral properties of client updates, including norm statistics, layer-wise ratios, sparsity measures, and low-order mo ments. Byzantine clients are identified by measuring robust sta tistical deviations in this low-dimensional fingerprint space with nd complexity, without modifying the underlying optimization procedure. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, ViT-Lite, and ViT-Small with LoRA adapters demonstrate that TinyGuard pre serves FedAvg convergence in benign settings and achieves up to 95 percent accuracy under multiple Byzantine attack scenarios, including sign-flipping, scaling, noise injection, and label poisoning. Against adaptive white-box adversaries, Pareto frontier analysis across four orders of magnitude confirms that attackers cannot simultaneously evade detection and achieve effective poisoning, features we term statistical handcuffs. Ablation studies validate stable detection precision 0.8 across varying client counts (50-150), threshold parameters and extreme data heterogeneity .

However, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA have created data silos that prevent centralized training. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw patient data. Despite its potential, FL remains vulnerable to poisoning and Sybil attacks, in which malicious participants corrupt the global model or infiltrate the network using fake identities. While recent approaches integrate Blockchain technology for auditability, they predominantly rely on probabilistic reputation systems rather than robust cryptographic identity verification. This paper proposes a Trustworthy Blockchain-based Federated Learning (TBFL) framework integrating Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) standards. By leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), our architecture ensures only authenticated healthcare entities contribute to the global model. Through comprehensive evaluation using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we demonstrate that anchoring trust in cryptographic identity verification rather than behavioral patterns significantly mitigates security risks while maintaining clinical utility. Our results show the framework successfully neutralizes 100% of Sybil attacks, achieves robust predictive performance (AUC = 0.954, Recall = 0.890), and introduces negligible computational overhead (<0.12%).

In the current AI-first threatscape, deceptive URLs have reached unprecedented sophistication due to the widespread use of generative AI by cybercriminals and the AI-vs-AI arms race to produce context-aware phishing websites and URLs that are virtually indistinguishable to both users and traditional detection tools. Although AI-generated phishing accounted for a small fraction of filter-bypassing attacks in 2024, phishing volume has escalated over 4,000% since 2022, with nearly 50% more attacks evading detection. At the rate the threatscape is escalating, and phishing tactics are emerging faster than labeled data can be produced, zero-shot and few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs) offers a timely and adaptable solution, enabling generalization with minimal supervision. Given the critical importance of phishing URL detection in large-scale cybersecurity defense systems, we present a comprehensive benchmark of LLMs under a unified zero-shot and few-shot prompting framework and reveal operational trade-offs. Our evaluation uses a balanced dataset with consistent prompts, offering detailed analysis of performance, generalization, and model efficacy, quantified by accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC, to reflect both classification quality and practical utility in threat detection settings. We conclude few-shot prompting improves performance across multiple LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9493\u9c7cURL\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edfURL\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800cAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9493\u9c7c\u653b\u51fb\u6b63\u4ee5\u60ca\u4eba\u901f\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfURL\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u6297\u6b3a\u8bc8\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u800cAI\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u9493\u9c7cURL\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u590d\u6742\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9493\u9c7c\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\uff082022\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u589e\u957f4000%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd150%\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u5a01\u80c1\u6f14\u53d8\u901f\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001F1\u5206\u6570\u3001AUROC\u548cAUPRC\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86LLM\u5728\u9493\u9c7cURL\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u6743\u8861\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u9493\u9c7cURL\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ca\u65f6\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Our construction generalizes the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson zero-knowledge protocol to arbitrary k >= 3, applies the Fiat-Shamir transform, and uses Merkle-tree commitments to compress signatures from O(tn) to O(t log n). Crucially, we generate hard instances via planted \"quiet\" colorings that preserve the statistical profile of random graphs. We present the first empirical security analysis of such a scheme against both classical solvers (ILP, DSatur) and a custom graph neural network (GNN) attacker. Experiments show that for n >= 60, neither approach recovers the secret coloring, demonstrating that well-engineered k-coloring instances can resist modern cryptanalysis, including machine learning.

Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables computation directly on encrypted messages and thus offers a compelling approach to privacy-preserving data processing in ITS. However, practical HE schemes incur substantial ciphertext expansion and communication overhead, which limits their suitability for time-critical transportation systems. Hybrid homomorphic encryption (HHE) addresses this challenge by combining a homomorphic encryption scheme with a symmetric cipher, enabling efficient encrypted computation while dramatically reducing communication cost. In this paper, we develop theoretical models of representative ITS applications that integrate HHE to protect sensitive vehicular data. We then perform a parameter-based evaluation of the HHE scheme Rubato to estimate ciphertext sizes and communication overhead under realistic ITS workloads. Our results show that HHE achieves orders-of-magnitude reductions in ciphertext size compared with conventional HE while maintaining cryptographic security, making it significantly more practical for latency-constrained ITS communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "HHE\u7ed3\u5408\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e0e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bc6\u7801\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5bc6\u6587\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4f7f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6ITS\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528", "motivation": "ITS\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u5bc6\u6587\u81a8\u80c0\u4e25\u91cd\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6574\u5408HHE\u7684ITS\u5e94\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30Rubato HHE\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5bc6\u6587\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500", "result": "HHE\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfHE\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u5bc6\u6587\u5927\u5c0f\u7f29\u51cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bc6\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53d7\u9650\u7684ITS\u901a\u4fe1", "conclusion": "HHE\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bc6\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6ITS\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528"}}

However, such privacy definitions are rarely used in practice because they do not always compose. For example, it is possible to design algorithms for these privacy definitions that have no leakage when run once but reveal the entire dataset when run more than once. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions that must be added to ensure linear composition for Pufferfish mechanisms, hence avoiding such privacy collapse. These extra conditions turn out to be differential privacy-style inequalities, indicating that achieving both the interpretable semantics of Pufferfish for correlated data and composition benefits requires adopting differentially private mechanisms to Pufferfish.

Machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are increasingly deployed to protect CAN traffic, yet their robustness against adversarial manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present a systematic adversarial evaluation of CAN IDS using the ROAD dataset, comparing four shallow learning models with a deep neural network-based detector. Using protocol-compliant, payload-level perturbations generated via FGSM, BIM and PGD, we evaluate adversarial effects on both benign and malicious CAN frames. While all models achieve strong baseline performance under benign conditions, adversarial perturbations reveal substantial vulnerabilities. Although shallow and deep models are robust to false-alarm induction, with the deep neural network (DNN) performing best on benign traffic, all architectures suffer significant increases in missed attacks. Notably, under gradient-based attacks, the shallow model extra trees (ET) demonstrates improved robustness to missed-attack induction compared to the other models.

However, their practical deployment faces two major limitations: domain shift, where models trained in one environment struggle to generalize to others, and the black-box nature of DNNs, which limits interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates a group of variable-length two-dimensional (2D) shapelets with a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to achieve efficient, interpretable, and generalizable RF fingerprinting. The 2D shapelets explicitly capture diverse local temporal patterns across the in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) components, providing compact and interpretable representations. Complementarily, the pre-trained LLM captures more long-range dependencies and global contextual information, enabling strong generalization with minimal training overhead.

In this work, we present a practical scanner for identifying sleeper agent-style backdoors in causal language models. Our approach relies on two key findings: first, sleeper agents tend to memorize poisoning data, making it possible to leak backdoor examples using memory extraction techniques. Second, poisoned LLMs exhibit distinctive patterns in their output distributions and attention heads when backdoor triggers are present in the input. Guided by these observations, we develop a scalable backdoor scanning methodology that assumes no prior knowledge of the trigger or target behavior and requires only inference operations.

However, the external data which agent consumes also leads to the risk of indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in third-party content hijack agent behavior. Guided by benchmarks, such as AgentDojo, there has been significant amount of progress in developing defense against the said attacks. As the technology continues to mature, and that agents are increasingly being relied upon for more complex tasks, there is increasing pressing need to also evolve the benchmark to reflect threat landscape faced by emerging agentic systems. In this work, we reveal three fundamental flaws in current benchmarks and push the frontier along these dimensions: (i) lack of dynamic open-ended tasks, (ii) lack of helpful instructions, and (iii) simplistic user tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentDyn, a manually designed benchmark featuring 60 challenging open-ended tasks and 560 injection test cases across Shopping, GitHub, and Daily Life. Unlike prior static benchmarks, AgentDyn requires dynamic planning and incorporates helpful third-party instructions. Our evaluation of ten state-of-the-art defenses suggests that almost all existing defenses are either not secure enough or suffer from significant over-defense, revealing that existing defenses are still far from real-world deployment.

Unlike traditional bugs such as reentrancy or arithmetic errors, these vulnerabilities arise from missing or incorrectly enforced business invariants and are tightly coupled with protocol semantics. Existing static analysis techniques struggle to capture such high-level logic, while recent large language model based approaches often suffer from unstable outputs and low accuracy due to hallucination and limited verification.\n  In this paper, we propose LogicScan, an automated contrastive auditing framework for detecting business logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The key insight behind LogicScan is that mature, widely deployed on-chain protocols implicitly encode well-tested and consensus-driven business invariants. LogicScan systematically mines these invariants from large-scale on-chain contracts and reuses them as reference constraints to audit target contracts. To achieve this, LogicScan introduces a Business Specification Language (BSL) to normalize diverse implementation patterns into structured, verifiable logic representations. It further combines noise-aware logic aggregation with contrastive auditing to identify missing or weakly enforced invariants while mitigating LLM-induced false positives.\n  We evaluate LogicScan on three real-world datasets, including DeFiHacks, Web3Bugs, and a set of top-200 audited contracts. The results show that LogicScan achieves an F1 score of 85.2%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art tools while maintaining a low false-positive rate on production-grade contracts. Additional experiments demonstrate that LogicScan maintains consistent performance across different LLMs and is cost-effective, and that its false-positive suppression mechanisms substantially improve robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "LogicScan\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6210\u719f\u94fe\u4e0a\u534f\u8bae\u6316\u6398\u4e1a\u52a1\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "motivation": "\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u7834\u574f\u6027\u4f46\u6700\u4e0d\u4e3a\u4eba\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u7ea7\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLogicScan\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u94fe\u4e0a\u5408\u7ea6\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u4e1a\u52a1\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u4e1a\u52a1\u89c4\u8303\u8bed\u8a00(BSL)\u5c06\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\uff1b3) \u7ed3\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8bc6\u522b\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u5f31\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf", "result": "\u5728DeFiHacks\u3001Web3Bugs\u548ctop-200\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5408\u7ea6\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe85.2%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u5408\u7ea6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8", "conclusion": "LogicScan\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6210\u719f\u94fe\u4e0a\u534f\u8bae\u6316\u6398\u4e1a\u52a1\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02"}}

We study a timing-only adversary that retimes existing spikes while preserving spike counts and amplitudes in event-driven SNNs, thus remaining rate-preserving. We formalize a capacity-1 spike-retiming threat model with a unified trio of budgets: per-spike jitter $\\mathcal{B}_{\\infty}$, total delay $\\mathcal{B}_{1}$, and tamper count $\\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Feasible adversarial examples must satisfy timeline consistency and non-overlap, which makes the search space discrete and constrained. To optimize such retimings at scale, we use projected-in-the-loop (PIL) optimization: shift-probability logits yield a differentiable soft retiming for backpropagation, and a strict projection in the forward pass produces a feasible discrete schedule that satisfies capacity-1, non-overlap, and the chosen budget at every step. The objective maximizes task loss on the projected input and adds a capacity regularizer together with budget-aware penalties, which stabilizes gradients and aligns optimization with evaluation. Across event-driven benchmarks (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST) and diverse SNN architectures, we evaluate under binary and integer event grids and a range of retiming budgets, and also test models trained with timing-aware adversarial training designed to counter timing-only attacks.

In practice, black-box watermarks manifest as specific predictive behaviors for specially crafted samples. However, due to the generalization nature of DNNs, the keys to extracting the watermark message are not unique, which would provide attackers with more opportunities. Advanced attack techniques can reverse-engineer approximate replacements for the original watermark keys, enabling subsequent watermark removal. In this paper, we explore black-box DNN watermarking specificity, which refers to the accuracy of a watermark's response to a key. Using this concept, we introduce Specificity-Enhanced Watermarking (SEW), a new method that improves specificity by reducing the association between the watermark and approximate keys. Through extensive evaluation using three popular watermarking benchmarks, we validate that enhancing specificity significantly contributes to strengthening robustness against removal attacks.

However, their effectiveness is often limited by high false-positive rates and incomplete coverage of vulnerability classes. At the same time, developers frequently document security-related shortcuts and compromises as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in software artifacts, such as code comments. While prior work has recognized SATD as a rich source of security information, it remains unclear whether -and in what ways- it is utilized during SAT-aided security analysis. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the extent to which security-related SATD complements the output produced by SATs and helps bridge some of their well-known limitations. METHOD: We followed a mixed-methods approach consisting of (i) the analysis of a SATD-annotated vulnerability dataset using three state-of-the-art SATs and (ii) an online survey with 72 security practitioners. RESULTS: The combined use of all SATs flagged 114 of the 135 security-related SATD instances, spanning 24 distinct Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers. A manual mapping of the SATD comments revealed 33 unique CWE types, 6 of which correspond to categories that SATs commonly overlook or struggle to detect (e.g., race conditions). Survey responses further suggest that developers frequently pair SAT outputs with SATD insights to better understand the impact and root causes of security weaknesses and to identify suitable fixes.

This evolution introduces concept drift, in which the statistical properties of malware features change over time, reducing the effectiveness of static machine learning models. Understanding and explaining this drift is essential for maintaining robust and trustworthy malware detectors. In this paper, we propose an interpretable approach to concept drift detection. Our method uses a rule-based classifier to generate human-readable descriptions of both original and evolved malware samples belonging to the same malware family. By comparing the resulting rule sets using a similarity function, we can detect and quantify concept drift. Crucially, this comparison also identifies the specific features and feature values that have changed, providing clear explanations of how malware has evolved to bypass detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only accurately detects drift but also provides actionable insights into the behavior of evolving malware families, supporting both detection and threat analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5219\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8bfb\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b0\u65e7\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6837\u672c\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6301\u7eed\u6f14\u5316\u4ee5\u9003\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u9759\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u6f02\u79fb\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ef4\u62a4\u7a33\u5065\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e3a\u540c\u4e00\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u6837\u672c\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u4f53\u54ea\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u6f14\u5316\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5bb6\u65cf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5a01\u80c1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7ef4\u62a4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We study how mismatches between externally presented tool descriptions and underlying implementations systematically shape the mental models and decision-making behavior of intelligent agents. Specifically, we present the first large-scale study of description-code inconsistency in the MCP ecosystem. We design an automated static analysis framework and apply it to 10,240 real-world MCP Servers across 36 categories. Our results show that while most servers are highly consistent, approximately 13% exhibit substantial mismatches that can enable undocumented privileged operations, hidden state mutations, or unauthorized financial actions. We further observe systematic differences across application categories, popularity levels, and MCP marketplaces.

For security smell detection, on the Stack Overflow dataset, which primarily contains small, simplified code snippets, the models detected at least 71% of security smells when prompted to analyze code from a security perspective (general prompt). With a guided prompt (adding clear, step-by-step instructions), this increased to 78%.In GitHub repositories, which contain complete, real-world project scripts, a general prompt was less effective, leaving more than half of the smells undetected. However, with the guided prompt, the models uncovered at least 67% of the smells. For secure code generation, we prompted LLMs with 89 vulnerable synthetic scenarios and observed that only 7% of the generated scripts were secure. Adding an explicit instruction to generate secure code increased GPT secure output rate to 17%, while Gemini changed little (8%).

Existing electromagnetic (EM) side-channel-based detection techniques often rely on golden references or labeled data, which are infeasible in modern distributed manufacturing. This paper introduces a reference-free, design-agnostic framework for detecting triggered HTs directly from post-silicon EM emissions. The proposed flow converts each EM trace into a time-frequency scalogram using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), extracts discriminative features through a convolutional neural network (CNN), reduces dimensionality with principal component analysis (PCA), and applies Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Modeling (BGMM) for unsupervised probabilistic clustering. The framework quantifies detection confidence using posterior-based metrics (alpha_{post}, beta_{post}), Bayesian information criterion (Delta BIC), and Mahalanobis cluster separation (D), enabling interpretable anomaly decisions without golden data. Experimental validation on AES-128 designs embedded with four different HTs demonstrates high separability between HT-free and HT-activated conditions and robustness to PCA variance thresholds. The results highlight the method's scalability, statistical interpretability, and potential for extension to runtime and in-field HT monitoring in trusted microelectronics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u3001\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u6728\u9a6c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u78c1\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u3001CNN\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001PCA\u964d\u7ef4\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u786c\u4ef6\u6728\u9a6c\u5a01\u80c1\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u78c1\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u9ec4\u91d1\u53c2\u8003\u6216\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7535\u78c1\u8ff9\u7ebf\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u65f6\u9891\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u5224\u522b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u964d\u7ef4\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6982\u7387\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u6728\u9a6c\u7684AES-128\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u786c\u4ef6\u6728\u9a6c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u672a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9PCA\u65b9\u5dee\u9608\u503c\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u548c\u73b0\u573a\u786c\u4ef6\u6728\u9a6c\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5fae\u7535\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

In order to protect users' rights to informational self-determination, regulatory approaches for the collection and processing of personal data have been developed, such as the EU's GDPR. However, inspecting the compliance of mobile apps with privacy regulations remains difficult. Thus, in order to enable end users and enforcement bodies to verify and enforce data protection compliance, we propose mopri, a conceptual framework designed for analyzing the behavior of mobile apps through a comprehensive, adaptable, and user-centered approach. Recognizing the gaps in existing frameworks, mopri serves as a foundation for integrating various analysis tools into a streamlined, modular pipeline that employs static and dynamic analysis methods. Building on this concept, a prototype has been developed which effectively extracts permissions and tracking libraries while employing robust methods for dynamic traffic recording and decryption. Additionally, it incorporates result enrichment and reporting features that enhance the clarity and usability of the analysis outcomes.

Existing methods for detecting and localizing such attacks achieve limited effectiveness, as their underlying assumptions often do not hold in the web-agent setting. In this work, we propose WebSentinel, a two-step approach for detecting and localizing prompt injection attacks in webpages. Given a webpage, Step I extracts \\emph{segments of interest} that may be contaminated, and Step II evaluates each segment by checking its consistency with the webpage content as context. We show that WebSentinel is highly effective, substantially outperforming baseline methods across multiple datasets of both contaminated and clean webpages that we collected.

### [1] [Synergizing Static Analysis with Large Language Models for Vulnerability Discovery and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15433)
*Vaibhav Agrawal,Kiarash Ahi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将大型语言模型（LLMs）与静态应用安全测试（SAST）结合以改进漏洞发现的协同效应。通过整合这两种技术，创建了一个更智能高效的系统，显著降低了误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAST工具虽然对主动安全有效，但存在高误报率和缺乏上下文理解的限制。而LLMs擅长代码分析和模式识别，但容易产生不一致和幻觉。结合两者可以发挥各自优势，弥补不足。

Method: 通过将LLMs与SAST技术集成，创建了一个智能系统。该系统不仅优化漏洞检测，还能提供改进的分类、动态bug描述、通过漏洞利用生成进行bug验证，以及增强复杂代码库的分析能力。

Result: SAST-Genius系统相比单独使用Semgrep，误报率降低了约91%（从225个减少到20个），显著提升了安全检测的准确性。

Conclusion: LLMs与SAST的结合创造了一个更有效的安全方法，充分利用了两种技术的优势，同时减轻了各自的弱点，将安全转变为深度集成、上下文感知的过程。

Abstract: This report examines the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to improve vulnerability discovery.
Traditional SAST tools, while effective for proactive security, are limited by
high false-positive rates and a lack of contextual understanding. Conversely,
LLMs excel at code analysis and pattern recognition but can be prone to
inconsistencies and hallucinations. By integrating these two technologies, a
more intelligent and efficient system is created. This combination moves beyond
mere vulnerability detection optimization, transforming security into a deeply
integrated, contextual process that provides tangible benefits like improved
triage, dynamic bug descriptions, bug validation via exploit generation and
enhanced analysis of complex codebases. The result is a more effective security
approach that leverages the strengths of both technologies while mitigating
their weaknesses. SAST-Genius reduced false positives by about 91 % (225 to 20)
compared to Semgrep alone.

### [2] [Adversarially Robust Assembly Language Model for Packed Executables Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15499)
*Shijia Li,Jiang Ming,Lanqing Liu,Longwei Yang,Ni Zhang,Chunfu Jia*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Pack-ALM是一种基于深度学习的打包可执行文件检测方法，将打包检测重新定义为区分合法指令和"伪"指令的任务，通过预训练的汇编语言模型识别打包数据的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的打包检测方法依赖经验特征（如高熵或特定二进制模式），容易受到对抗性样本或未知打包器的规避，且依赖专家手工特征难以持续演进。

Method: 将原生数据和打包数据预处理为"伪"指令，设计预训练的汇编语言模型来识别打包数据的特征，通过深度学习区分合法指令和打包产生的伪指令。

Result: 在超过37,000个样本上的实验表明，Pack-ALM能有效识别打包二进制文件，包括对抗性或未见过的打包技术创建的样本，在检测准确性和对抗鲁棒性上均优于传统熵基方法和先进汇编语言模型。

Conclusion: Pack-ALM提供了一种更有效和鲁棒的打包检测解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性，为大规模恶意软件分析和杀毒引擎工作流程提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Detecting packed executables is a critical component of large-scale malware
analysis and antivirus engine workflows, as it identifies samples that warrant
computationally intensive dynamic unpacking to reveal concealed malicious
behavior. Traditionally, packer detection techniques have relied on empirical
features, such as high entropy or specific binary patterns. However, these
empirical, feature-based methods are increasingly vulnerable to evasion by
adversarial samples or unknown packers (e.g., low-entropy packers).
Furthermore, the dependence on expert-crafted features poses challenges in
sustaining and evolving these methods over time.
  In this paper, we examine the limitations of existing packer detection
methods and propose Pack-ALM, a novel deep-learning-based approach for
detecting packed executables. Inspired by the linguistic concept of
distinguishing between real and pseudo words, we reformulate packer detection
as a task of differentiating between legitimate and "pseudo" instructions. To
achieve this, we preprocess native data and packed data into "pseudo"
instructions and design a pre-trained assembly language model that recognizes
features indicative of packed data. We evaluate Pack-ALM against leading
industrial packer detection tools and state-of-the-art assembly language
models. Extensive experiments on over 37,000 samples demonstrate that Pack-ALM
effectively identifies packed binaries, including samples created with
adversarial or previously unseen packing techniques. Moreover, Pack-ALM
outperforms traditional entropy-based methods and advanced assembly language
models in both detection accuracy and adversarial robustness.

### [3] [Fluid Antenna System-assisted Physical Layer Secret Key Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15547)
*Zhiyu Huang,Guyue Li,Hao Xu,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文研究多天线基站系统中的物理层密钥生成（PLKG），通过流体天线系统（FAS）动态定制无线电环境来提升密钥生成率（KGR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在不增加额外节点或大量射频链的情况下，利用FAS的自适应天线端口选择能力，通过利用信道空间相关性来增强合法节点的密钥生成率。

Method: 提出FAS辅助的PLKG模型，结合发射波束成形和稀疏端口选择；针对独立同分布和空间相关信道模型分别制定非凸优化问题；提出基于连续凸近似和柯西-施瓦茨不等式的迭代算法；应用重加权ℓ₁范数算法促进稀疏端口激活；提出基于瑞利商分析的低复杂度滑动窗口端口选择方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，FAS-PLKG方案在独立和空间相关环境中均显著优于FA-PLKG方案；滑动窗口端口选择方法比重加权ℓ₁范数方法产生更高的KGR；FAS通过动态稀疏端口选择以更少的射频链实现更高的KGR。

Conclusion: FAS通过动态定制无线电环境和稀疏端口选择，能够有效提升物理层密钥生成的效率和性能，为多天线系统提供了一种高效的密钥生成解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates physical-layer key generation (PLKG) in multi-antenna
base station systems, by leveraging a fluid antenna system (FAS) to dynamically
customize radio environments. Without requiring additional nodes or extensive
radio frequency chains, the FAS effectively enables adaptive antenna port
selection by exploiting channel spatial correlation to enhance the key
generation rate (KGR) at legitimate nodes. To comprehensively evaluate the
efficiency of the FAS in PLKG, we propose an FAS-assisted PLKG model that
integrates transmit beamforming and sparse port selection under independent and
identically distributed and spatially correlated channel models, respectively.
Specifically, the PLKG utilizes reciprocal channel probing to derive a
closed-form KGR expression based on the mutual information between legitimate
channel estimates. Nonconvex optimization problems for these scenarios are
formulated to maximize the KGR subject to transmit power constraints and sparse
port activation. We propose an iterative algorithm by capitalizing on
successive convex approximation and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to obtain a
locally optimal solution. A reweighted $\ell_1$-norm-based algorithm is applied
to advocate for the sparse port activation of FAS-assisted PLKG. Furthermore, a
low-complexity sliding window-based port selection is proposed to substitute
reweighted $\ell_1$-norm method based on Rayleigh-quotient analysis. Simulation
results demonstrate that the FAS-PLKG scheme significantly outperforms the
FA-PLKG scheme in both independent and spatially correlated environments. The
sliding window-based port selection method introduced in this paper has been
shown to yield superior KGR, compared to the reweighted $\ell_1$-norm method.
It is shown that the FAS achieves higher KGR with fewer RF chains through
dynamic sparse port selection.

### [4] [Hybrid Deep Learning-Federated Learning Powered Intrusion Detection System for IoT/5G Advanced Edge Computing Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15555)
*Rasil Baidar,Sasa Maric,Robert Abbas*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合CNN、BiLSTM和自编码器的隐私保护联邦学习入侵检测系统，用于5G-Advanced IoT安全防护


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着IoT和5G-Advanced应用的指数级增长，DDoS、恶意软件和零日入侵的攻击面不断扩大，需要有效的入侵检测解决方案

Method: 在隐私保护联邦学习框架下融合CNN-BiLSTM分支（捕获局部和门控跨特征交互）和自编码器瓶颈（强调基于重构的异常敏感性），在边缘设备上训练而不共享原始数据

Result: 在UNSW-NB15数据集上达到AUC 99.59%和F1分数97.36%，平均推理时间0.0476ms/样本，满足URLLC小于10ms的预算要求

Conclusion: 该系统支持边缘部署，具备可解释性、漂移容忍性，为合规、可扩展的5G-Advanced IoT安全提供了解决方案

Abstract: The exponential expansion of IoT and 5G-Advanced applications has enlarged
the attack surface for DDoS, malware, and zero-day intrusions. We propose an
intrusion detection system that fuses a convolutional neural network (CNN), a
bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and an autoencoder (AE) bottleneck within a
privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) framework. The CNN-BiLSTM branch
captures local and gated cross-feature interactions, while the AE emphasizes
reconstruction-based anomaly sensitivity. Training occurs across edge devices
without sharing raw data. On UNSW-NB15 (binary), the fused model attains AUC
99.59 percent and F1 97.36 percent; confusion-matrix analysis shows balanced
error rates with high precision and recall. Average inference time is
approximately 0.0476 ms per sample on our test hardware, which is well within
the less than 10 ms URLLC budget, supporting edge deployment. We also discuss
explainability, drift tolerance, and FL considerations for compliant, scalable
5G-Advanced IoT security.

### [5] [Cuckoo Attack: Stealthy and Persistent Attacks Against AI-IDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15572)
*Xinpeng Liu,Junming Liu,Peiyu Liu,Han Zheng,Qinying Wang,Mathias Payer,Shouling Ji,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Cuckoo Attack是一种针对AI集成开发环境的新型攻击，通过在配置文件中嵌入恶意载荷实现隐蔽持久化命令执行，可入侵开发者本地计算机并实现供应链攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI-IDE采用Agent中心架构，但深度集成的LLM代理引入了新的攻击面。攻击者可通过注入恶意指令劫持代理执行有害操作，而现有攻击方法缺乏隐蔽性和持久性。

Method: 将恶意载荷嵌入AI-IDE常用的配置文件中，这些文件在常规操作期间执行系统命令但不向用户显示执行细节。攻击分为初始感染和持久化两个阶段。

Result: 在9个主流Agent和AI-IDE对上验证了攻击可行性，证明该攻击不仅能入侵开发者本地计算机，还能通过配置文件传播实现供应链攻击。

Conclusion: 提出了7个可操作的安全检查点供厂商评估产品安全性，强调了AI-IDE安全防护的紧迫性。

Abstract: Modern AI-powered Integrated Development Environments (AI-IDEs) are
increasingly defined by an Agent-centric architecture, where an LLM-powered
Agent is deeply integrated to autonomously execute complex tasks. This tight
integration, however, also introduces a new and critical attack surface.
Attackers can exploit these components by injecting malicious instructions into
untrusted external sources, effectively hijacking the Agent to perform harmful
operations beyond the user's intention or awareness. This emerging threat has
quickly attracted research attention, leading to various proposed attack
vectors, such as hijacking Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers to access
private data. However, most existing approaches lack stealth and persistence,
limiting their practical impact.
  We propose the Cuckoo Attack, a novel attack that achieves stealthy and
persistent command execution by embedding malicious payloads into configuration
files. These files, commonly used in AI-IDEs, execute system commands during
routine operations, without displaying execution details to the user. Once
configured, such files are rarely revisited unless an obvious runtime error
occurs, creating a blind spot for attackers to exploit. We formalize our attack
paradigm into two stages, including initial infection and persistence. Based on
these stages, we analyze the practicality of the attack execution process and
identify the relevant exploitation techniques. Furthermore, we analyze the
impact of Cuckoo Attack, which can not only invade the developer's local
computer but also achieve supply chain attacks through the spread of
configuration files. We contribute seven actionable checkpoints for vendors to
evaluate their product security. The critical need for these checks is
demonstrated by our end-to-end Proof of Concept, which validated the proposed
attack across nine mainstream Agent and AI-IDE pairs.

### [6] [Future-Proofing Cloud Security Against Quantum Attacks: Risk, Transition, and Mitigation Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15653)
*Yaser Baseri,Abdelhakim Hafid,Arash Habibi Lashkari*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文全面调查了量子计算对云计算安全的威胁，分析了量子攻击向量，提出了分层安全框架，并评估了主要云服务提供商向抗量子密码学的过渡策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算的发展对传统密码系统构成重大威胁，需要为云计算基础设施开发量子安全的安全解决方案，确保云环境在量子时代的持续安全。

Method: 采用基于STRIDE模型的结构化风险评估方法，分析量子威胁在整个云计算堆栈中的影响；提出集成混合密码过渡策略、密码敏捷性和主动风险缓解的分层安全框架。

Result: 评估了主要云服务提供商（AWS、Azure、GCP）的抗量子密码学准备情况，详细分析了标准化PQC算法在云原生部署中的抗侧信道和主动攻击能力。

Conclusion: 确定了六个关键未来研究方向：标准化与互操作性、性能与可扩展性、实现安全性、与新兴技术集成、系统性准备和密码敏捷迁移框架。

Abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) introduces a transformative threat to digital
security, with the potential to compromise widely deployed classical
cryptographic systems. This survey offers a comprehensive and systematic
examination of quantumsafe security for Cloud Computing (CC), focusing on the
vulnerabilities, transition strategies, and mitigation mechanisms required to
secure cloud infrastructures in the quantum era. We evaluated the landscape of
quantum threats across the entire CC stack, demonstrating how quantum
algorithms can undermine classical encryption and compromise cloud security at
multiple architectural layers. Using a structured risk assessment methodology
based on the STRIDE model, we evaluate quantum-induced attack vectors and their
impact on cloud environments. To address these challenges, we propose a layered
security framework that integrates hybrid cryptographic transition strategies,
cryptographic agility, and proactive risk mitigation. We analyze the
preparation and implementation approaches of the major Cloud Service Providers
(CSPs), including AWS, Azure and GCP, synthesizing platform-specific
initiatives toward Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Furthermore, we provide a
detailed evaluation of standardized PQC algorithms, exploring their resilience
to side-channel and active attacks within cloud-native deployments. This survey
serves as a strategic reference for cloud architects, policymakers, and
researchers, offering actionable insights for navigating the complex transition
to quantum-resilient cloud systems. We conclude by identifying six key future
research directions: standardization and interoperability, performance and
scalability, implementation security, integration with emerging technologies,
systemic preparedness, and crypto-agile migration frameworks.

### [7] [Inference Attacks on Encrypted Online Voting via Traffic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15694)
*Anastasiia Belousova,Francesco Marchiori,Mauro Conti*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文研究在线投票系统中加密网络流量的元数据分析攻击，发现即使不访问加密内容，攻击者也能推断出选民的关键行为，如是否投票、投票提交时间以及选票是否有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线投票的普及，确保系统安全变得至关重要。现有研究主要关注密码协议设计，但网络流量分析等其他攻击向量研究不足，可能对选民隐私和系统可信度构成重大威胁。

Method: 使用基于规则的技术和机器学习方法分析加密网络流量的元数据，测试对两种广泛使用的在线投票平台（一个专有，一个部分开源）的攻击效果。

Result: 攻击分类准确率高达99.5%，暴露了严重的隐私漏洞，威胁到选举安全的关键属性，包括选民保密性和防止胁迫或买票。

Conclusion: 研究表明在线投票系统存在显著的隐私风险，但通过有效载荷填充和时间戳均衡化等缓解措施可以显著限制这些攻击的效果。

Abstract: Online voting enables individuals to participate in elections remotely,
offering greater efficiency and accessibility in both governmental and
organizational settings. As this method gains popularity, ensuring the security
of online voting systems becomes increasingly vital, as the systems supporting
it must satisfy a demanding set of security requirements. Most research in this
area emphasizes the design and verification of cryptographic protocols to
protect voter integrity and system confidentiality. However, other vectors,
such as network traffic analysis, remain relatively understudied, even though
they may pose significant threats to voter privacy and the overall
trustworthiness of the system.
  In this paper, we examine how adversaries can exploit metadata from encrypted
network traffic to uncover sensitive information during online voting. Our
analysis reveals that, even without accessing the encrypted content, it is
possible to infer critical voter actions, such as whether a person votes, the
exact moment a ballot is submitted, and whether the ballot is valid or spoiled.
We test these attacks with both rule-based techniques and machine learning
methods. We evaluate our attacks on two widely used online voting platforms,
one proprietary and one partially open source, achieving classification
accuracy as high as 99.5%. These results expose a significant privacy
vulnerability that threatens key properties of secure elections, including
voter secrecy and protection against coercion or vote-buying. We explore
mitigations to our attacks, demonstrating that countermeasures such as payload
padding and timestamp equalization can substantially limit their effectiveness.

### [8] [Flying Drones to Locate Cyber-Attackers in LoRaWAN Metropolitan Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15725)
*Matteo Repetto,Enrico Cambiaso,Fabio Patrone,Sandro Zappatore*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FOLLOWME项目提出使用无人机定位和追踪无线网络攻击者，通过结合网络遥测和无线定位技术来应对物联网安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无线网络攻击难以溯源，特别是使用便携设备进行的移动攻击，需要开发能够精确定位攻击者位置的技术来有效阻止攻击。

Method: 开发一个网络物理安全框架，集成网络遥测和无线定位技术。网络遥测检测异常并粗粒度定位受影响区域，无线定位系统扫描该区域精确定位攻击者位置。

Result: 项目专注于长距离城域网和LoRaWAN协议，为智慧城市服务提供安全解决方案。

Conclusion: 该项目为解决无线网络攻击溯源难题提供了创新方法，通过无人机技术实现攻击者的实时定位和追踪。

Abstract: Today, many critical services and industrial systems rely on wireless
networks for interaction with the IoT, hence becoming vulnerable to a broad
number of cyber-threats. While detecting this kind of attacks is not difficult
with common cyber-security tools, and even trivial for jamming, finding their
origin and identifying culprits is almost impossible today, yet indispensable
to stop them, especially when attacks are generated with portable or self-made
devices that continuously move around. To address this open challenge, the
FOLLOWME project investigates the feasibility of using UAV to locate and even
chase attackers during illicit usage of the radio spectrum. The main objective
is to develop a cyber-physical security framework that integrates network
telemetry with wireless localization. The former triggers alarms in case of
anomalies or known attack patterns and provides a coarse-grained indication of
the physical area (i.e., the position of affected access gateways), whereas the
latter systematically scans such area to identify the exact location of the
attacker. The project will specifically address long-range metropolitan area
networks and focus on the LoRaWAN protocol, which is the typical scenario for
Smart City services.

### [9] [Hornet Node and the Hornet DSL: A Minimal, Executable Specification for Bitcoin Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15754)
*Toby Sharp*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了Hornet DSL和Hornet Node，旨在为比特币共识规则提供首个可执行的正式规范，解决现有参考客户端代码不适合形式化验证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比特币的共识规则编码在其参考客户端实现中，但该代码存在副作用、可变状态、并发和遗留设计等问题，不适合形式化验证。需要独立的正式规范来支持跨版本验证和新客户端实现，减少共识分裂错误的风险。

Method: 开发了紧凑、可执行的声明式C++比特币共识规范，能够在单线程上几小时内同步主网到最新状态。引入了专门设计的Hornet DSL，用于无歧义地编码共识规则，支持形式化推理、共识代码生成和AI驱动的对抗测试。

Result: Hornet Node作为规范驱动的客户端，提供了现代模块化的参考客户端替代方案，具有分层设计、高效数据结构和强关注点分离等架构优势，性能适合实验和教学。

Conclusion: Hornet Node和Hornet DSL共同为比特币共识提供了首个可信的纯正式可执行规范路径，有望加强去中心化并降低共识分裂风险。

Abstract: Bitcoin's consensus rules are encoded in the implementation of its reference
client: "The code is the spec." Yet this code is unsuitable for formal
verification due to side effects, mutable state, concurrency, and legacy
design. A standalone formal specification would enable verification both across
versions of the reference client and against new client implementations,
strengthening decentralization by reducing the risk of consensus-splitting
bugs. Yet such a specification has long been considered intractable given the
complexity of Bitcoin's consensus logic. We demonstrate a compact, executable,
declarative C++ specification of Bitcoin consensus rules that syncs mainnet to
tip in a few hours on a single thread. We also introduce the Hornet
Domain-Specific Language (DSL) specifically designed to encode these rules
unambiguously for execution, enabling formal reasoning, consensus code
generation, and AI-driven adversarial testing. Our spec-driven client Hornet
Node offers a modern and modular complement to the reference client. Its clear,
idiomatic style makes it suitable for education, while its performance makes it
ideal for experimentation. We highlight architectural contributions such as its
layered design, efficient data structures, and strong separation of concerns,
supported by production-quality code examples. We argue that Hornet Node and
Hornet DSL together provide the first credible path toward a pure, formal,
executable specification of Bitcoin consensus.

### [10] [An Adversarial Robust Behavior Sequence Anomaly Detection Approach Based on Critical Behavior Unit Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15756)
*Dongyang Zhan,Kai Tan,Lin Ye,Xiangzhan Yu,Hongli Zhang,Zheng He*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于行为单元分析的对抗鲁棒性异常检测方法，通过提取行为单元来增强恶意软件分类器对对抗样本的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的序列模型（如RNN和LSTM）容易受到对抗样本攻击，攻击者可以通过改变行为序列的特征来误导恶意软件分类器。

Method: 提取相关行为作为行为单元，包含局部行为的代表性语义信息；基于多层次深度学习模型学习每个行为单元的整体语义和上下文关系，以缓解针对局部和大规模行为的扰动攻击。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于所有对比方法，对混淆攻击具有更好的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提高行为分析的鲁棒性，适用于低层和高层行为日志（如API和系统调用日志）。

Abstract: Sequential deep learning models (e.g., RNN and LSTM) can learn the sequence
features of software behaviors, such as API or syscall sequences. However,
recent studies have shown that these deep learning-based approaches are
vulnerable to adversarial samples. Attackers can use adversarial samples to
change the sequential characteristics of behavior sequences and mislead malware
classifiers. In this paper, an adversarial robustness anomaly detection method
based on the analysis of behavior units is proposed to overcome this problem.
We extract related behaviors that usually perform a behavior intention as a
behavior unit, which contains the representative semantic information of local
behaviors and can be used to improve the robustness of behavior analysis. By
learning the overall semantics of each behavior unit and the contextual
relationships among behavior units based on a multilevel deep learning model,
our approach can mitigate perturbation attacks that target local and
large-scale behaviors. In addition, our approach can be applied to both
low-level and high-level behavior logs (e.g., API and syscall logs). The
experimental results show that our approach outperforms all the compared
methods, which indicates that our approach has better performance against
obfuscation attacks.

### [11] [A High-performance Real-time Container File Monitoring Approach Based on Virtual Machine Introspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16030)
*Kai Tan,Dongyang Zhan,Lin Ye,Hongli Zhang,Binxing Fang,Zhihong Tian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一种基于虚拟机自省的高性能容器文件监控方法，解决现有容器文件监控安全性低和负载高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云计算的发展，容器安全成为云原生应用运行的关键因素。攻击者可通过篡改文件攻击容器服务甚至执行容器逃逸攻击。现有基于主机操作系统的文件监控方法在容器逃逸到主机后面临安全性弱的问题。

Method: 采用基于虚拟机自省的技术来监控容器文件，避免依赖主机操作系统的安全性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效监控容器文件，并引入可接受的监控负载。

Conclusion: 基于虚拟机自省的容器文件监控方法在保证安全性的同时实现了高性能监控。

Abstract: As cloud computing continues to advance and become an integral part of modern
IT infrastructure, container security has emerged as a critical factor in
ensuring the smooth operation of cloud-native applications. An attacker can
attack the service in the container or even perform the container escape attack
by tampering with the files. Monitoring container files is important for APT
detection and cyberspace security. Existing file monitoring methods are usually
based on host operating system or virtual machine introspection to protect file
security in real time. The methods based on the host operating system usually
monitor file operations in the host operating system. However, when the
container escapes to the host, the host operating system will no longer be
secure, so these methods face the problem of weak security. Aiming at the
problems of low security and high overload introduced in existing container
file monitoring, a high-performance container file monitoring method based on
virtual machine introspection is proposed. The experimental results show that
the proposed approach can effectively monitor the container files and introduce
an acceptable monitoring overload.

*Miel Verkerken,Laurens D'hooge,Bruno Volckaert,Filip De Turck,Giovanni Apruzzese*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ConCap是一个实用的工具，用于解决NIDS研究中的数据代表性问题，通过创建隔离的轻量级网络环境自动生成标记的网络数据，促进实验可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络入侵检测系统研究面临数据代表性挑战，现有文献结果可能存在问题，需要可靠的数据生成工具来支持安全评估。

Method: 基于开源软件设计ConCap工具，通过配置隔离网络环境自动产生标记的网络数据包和NetFlows，只需共享一个配置文件即可实现实验复现。

Result: 实验验证ConCap产生的网络数据与现实网络相似，功能上等同于其他环境收集的数据，并能安全复现复杂攻击链。

Conclusion: ConCap为困扰NIDS研究的"数据问题"提供了有效解决方案，有助于提升实验的科学性和可重复性。

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have been studied in research for
almost four decades. Yet, despite thousands of papers claiming scientific
advances, a non-negligible number of recent works suggest that the findings of
prior literature may be questionable. At the root of such a disagreement is the
well-known challenge of obtaining data representative of a real-world
network-and, hence, usable for security assessments. We tackle such a challenge
in this paper. We propose ConCap, a practical tool meant to facilitate
experimental research on NIDS. Through ConCap, a researcher can set up an
isolated and lightweight network environment and configure it to produce
network-related data, such as packets or NetFlows, that are automatically
labeled, hence ready for fine-grained experiments. ConCap is rooted on
open-source software and is designed to foster experimental reproducibility
across the scientific community by sharing just one configuration file. Through
comprehensive experiments on 10 different network activities, further expanded
via in-depth analyses of 21 variants of two specific activities and of 100
repetitions of four other ones, we empirically verify that ConCap produces
network data resembling that of a real-world network. We also carry out
experiments on well-known benchmark datasets as well as on a real "smart-home"
network, showing that, from a cyber-detection viewpoint, ConCap's
automatically-labeled NetFlows are functionally equivalent to those collected
in other environments. Finally, we show that ConCap enables to safely reproduce
sophisticated attack chains (e.g., to test/enhance existing NIDS). Altogether,
ConCap is a solution to the "data problem" that is plaguing NIDS research.

### [13] [How Exclusive are Ethereum Transactions? Evidence from non-winning blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16052)
*Vabuk Pahari,Andrea Canidio*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文分析了2024年12月3日以太坊区块链上15,097个区块提案，发现在获胜区块中，独占交易占总费用的84%，是构建者收入的主要来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究以太坊区块构建中的交易分类和费用分布，特别关注独占交易和私有交易对构建者收入的影响。

Method: 分析15,097个区块提案，将交易分类为独占交易（仅出现在单一构建者区块中）和私有交易（不在公共内存池但出现在多个构建者区块中），并分析交易日志。

Result: 独占交易占获胜区块总费用的84%，其中约7%的独占交易来自仅向单一构建者路由的发送者。即使排除重复策略交易，独占交易费用占比仍至少为77.2%。

Conclusion: 独占交易是以太坊区块构建者收入的主要来源，这种现象不能完全用发送者与构建者之间的独占关系来解释。

Abstract: We analyze 15,097 blocks proposed for inclusion in Ethereum's blockchain over
an 8-minute window on December 3, 2024, during which 38 blocks were added to
the chain. We classify transactions as exclusive -- present only in blocks from
a single builder -- or private -- absent from the public mempool but included
in blocks from multiple builders. We find that exclusive transactions account
for 84% of the total fees paid by transactions in winning blocks. Furthermore,
we show that exclusivity cannot be fully explained by exclusive relationships
between senders and builders: about 7% of all exclusive transactions included
on-chain, by value, come from senders who route exclusively to a single
builder. Analyzing transaction logs shows that some exclusive transactions are
duplicates or variations of the same strategy, but even accounting for that,
the share of the total fees paid by transactions in winning blocks is at least
77.2%. Taken together, our findings highlight that exclusive transactions are
the dominant source of builder revenues.

With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks\ntargeting IoT devices, there is a parallel rise in the development of malware\nacross various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). It is thus important to\nextend malware detection capacity to multiple ISAs. However, training a deep\nlearning-based malware detection model usually requires a large number of\nlabeled malware samples. The process of collecting and labeling sufficient\nmalware samples to build datasets for each ISA is labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming. To reduce the burden of data collection, we propose to leverage\nthe ideas of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) for\nmalware detection. Specifically, when dealing with malware in a certain ISA, we\ntranslate it to an ISA with sufficient malware samples (like X86-64). This\nallows us to apply a model trained on one ISA to analyze malware from another\nISA. Our approach reduces the data collection effort by enabling malware\ndetection across multiple ISAs using a model trained on a single ISA."}

We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended\ngoals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information\nleakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose\nsignificant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to\nguide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging\ntrends in TEE containerization design."}

Across\nExperiments 1-3 (July 2024-March 2025), 19-20 skilled attackers per experiment\nconducted two 8-hour days of self-paced operations in a simulated enterprise\nnetwork (SimSpace Cyber Force Platform) while we captured multi-modal data:\nself-reports (background, demographics, psychometrics), operational notes,\nterminal histories, keylogs, network packet captures (PCAP), and NIDS alerts\n(Suricata). Each participant began from a standardized Kali Linux VM and\npursued realistic objectives (e.g., target discovery and data exfiltration)\nunder controlled constraints. Derivative curated logs and labels are included.\nThe combined release supports research on attacker behavior modeling,\nbias-aware analytics, and method benchmarking. Data are available via IEEE\nDataport entries for Experiments 1-3."}

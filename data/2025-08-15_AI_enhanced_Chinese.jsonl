FL offers formal security guarantees when\ncombined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,\nhowever, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical\nutility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often\npresent in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these\ninterconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL\nframework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial\nexperiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,\nresulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first\nintegrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek\nLinks (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically\nuseful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using\na tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear\ntrade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the\noptimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal\noperational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong\nprivacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high\nclinical utility (recall greater than 77%).

Owing to the comparatively less\nstringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view\nthem as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns,\nwhich can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These\nattacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors\nto manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms,\nthereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and\nutility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based\nframework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential\nenergy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial\nNeural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy\nconsumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack\ntypes, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and\nsigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data.

The prototype agent\nsystem was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry\nin WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and\nanomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as\nfollows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service,\nand (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained\nby the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance\ndegradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were\nincreased, as a result of poor system adaptations.

However,\ntransmitting raw sensor data to a central server for training deep learning\nmodels introduces significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive\nmine-specific information. Federated Learning (FL) offers a transformative\nsolution by enabling collaborative model training while ensuring that raw data\nremains localized at each mine. Despite its advantages, FL in underground\nmining faces key challenges: (i) An attacker may compromise a mine's local\nmodel by employing techniques such as sign-flipping attacks or additive noise,\nleading to erroneous predictions; (ii) Low-quality (yet potentially valuable)\ndata, caused by poor lighting conditions or sensor inaccuracies in mines may\ndegrade the FL training process. In response, this paper proposes MineDetect, a\ndefense FL framework that detects and isolates the attacked models while\nmitigating the impact of mines with low-quality data. MineDetect introduces two\nkey innovations: (i) Detecting attacked models (maliciously manipulated) by\ndeveloping a history-aware mechanism that leverages local and global averages\nof gradient updates; (ii) Identifying and eliminating adversarial influences\nfrom unreliable models (generated by clients with poor data quality) on the FL\ntraining process. Comprehensive simulations across diverse datasets demonstrate\nthat MineDetect outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy,\neven in challenging non-IID data scenarios. Its ability to counter adversarial\ninfluences while maintaining lower computational efficiency makes it a vital\nadvancement for improving safety and operational effectiveness in underground\nmining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMineDetect\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u4e0b\u91c7\u77ff\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9694\u79bb\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u4e0b\u91c7\u77ff\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u8f93\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "MineDetect\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9FL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMineDetect\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "MineDetect\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5730\u4e0b\u91c7\u77ff\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

IoT devices suffer from\nthe inherent problem of resource constraints and are therefore susceptible to\nsuch resource-exhausting attacks. Traditional methods for detecting DDoS\nattacks are not efficient enough to cope with the dynamic nature of IoT\nnetworks, as well as the scalability of the attacks, diversity of protocols,\nhigh volume of traffic, and variability in device behavior, and variability of\nprotocols like MQTT, CoAP, making it hard to implement security across all the\nprotocols. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, i.e., the use of\nTransformer models, which have shown remarkable performance in natural language\nprocessing tasks, for detecting DDoS attacks on IoT devices.

However, recent studies have shown that\nthese systems are vulnerable to graph manipulation attacks, where attackers\nmanipulate the graph structure to evade detection. While some previous\napproaches have discussed this type of attack, none have fully addressed it\nwith a robust detection solution, limiting the practical applicability of\nPIDSes.\n  To address this challenge, we propose MirGuard, a robust anomaly detection\nframework that combines logic-aware multi-view augmentation with contrastive\nrepresentation learning. Rather than applying arbitrary structural\nperturbations, MirGuard introduces Logic-Aware Noise Injection (LNI) to\ngenerate semantically valid graph views, ensuring that all augmentations\npreserve the underlying causal semantics of the provenance data. These views\nare then used in a Logic-Preserving Contrastive Learning framework, which\nencourages the model to learn representations that are invariant to benign\ntransformations but sensitive to adversarial inconsistencies. Comprehensive\nevaluations on multiple provenance datasets demonstrate that MirGuard\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in robustness against\nvarious graph manipulation attacks without sacrificing detection performance\nand efficiency.

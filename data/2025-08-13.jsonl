However, it exposes a new class of timing\nside-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via\nshared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate\nleakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),\nmaking them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we\nintroduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware\nKV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries\nwhile confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three\ncomponents: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates\nrule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and\ncontext-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public\nand private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and\n(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual\ninformation leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of\ntiming-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,\nSafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across\ndiverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from\n50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with\nhigh cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of\nglobal sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM\ninference."}

While IC\ncamouflage techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, existing approaches\nlargely focus on localized gate modifications, neglecting comprehensive\ndeception strategies. To address this gap, we present a machine learning\n(ML)-driven methodology that integrates cryptic and mimetic cyber deception\nprinciples to enhance IC security against RE. Our approach leverages a novel\nAnd-Inverter Graph Variational Autoencoder (AIG-VAE) to encode circuit\nrepresentations, enabling dual-layered camouflage through functional\npreservation and appearance mimicry. By introducing new variants of covert\ngates -- Fake Inverters, Fake Buffers, and Universal Transmitters -- our\nmethodology achieves robust protection by obscuring circuit functionality while\npresenting misleading appearances. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our strategy in maintaining circuit functionality while\nachieving high camouflage and similarity scores with minimal structural\noverhead. Additionally, we validate the robustness of our method against\nadvanced artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced RE attacks, highlighting its\npractical applicability in securing IC designs.

However,\nexisting studies have been limited to organizing related techniques, attacks,\ndefenses, and risks in terms of specific domains or AI elements. Thus, it\nextremely difficult to understand the relationships among them and how negative\nimpacts on stakeholders are brought about. In this paper, we argue that the\nknowledge, technologies, and social impacts related to AI security should be\nholistically organized to help understand relationships among them. To this\nend, we first develop an AI security map that holistically organizes\ninterrelationships among elements related to AI security as well as negative\nimpacts on information systems and stakeholders. This map consists of the two\naspects, namely the information system aspect (ISA) and the external influence\naspect (EIA). The elements that AI should fulfill within information systems\nare classified under the ISA. The EIA includes elements that affect\nstakeholders as a result of AI being attacked or misused. For each element,\ncorresponding negative impacts are identified. By referring to the AI security\nmap, one can understand the potential negative impacts, along with their causes\nand countermeasures. Additionally, our map helps clarify how the negative\nimpacts on AI-based systems relate to those on stakeholders. We show some\nfindings newly obtained by referring to our map.

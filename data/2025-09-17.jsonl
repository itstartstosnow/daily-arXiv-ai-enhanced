We present a formal verification framework that\nmodels both detection logic and attack trees as labeled transition systems\n(LTSs), enabling automated conformance checking via bisimulation and weak trace\ninclusion. Detection rules specified in the Generic Threat Detection Language\n(GTDL, a general-purpose detection language we formalize in this work) are\nassigned a compositional operational semantics, and threat models expressed as\nattack trees are interpreted as LTSs through a structural trace semantics. Both\nrepresentations are translated to LNT, a modeling language supported by the\nCADP toolbox. This common semantic domain enables systematic and automated\nverification of detection coverage. We evaluate our approach on real-world\nmalware scenarios such as LokiBot and Emotet and provide scalability analysis\nthrough parametric synthetic models. Results confirm that our methodology\nidentifies semantic mismatches between threat models and detection rules,\nsupports iterative refinement, and scales to realistic threat landscapes."}

Recent advances\nin diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality\ntabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive\ninformation. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by\ndetermining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied\nin images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains\nunderexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited\nrecord diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference\nAttack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack\nspecifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs\nerrorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target\nrecords, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are\npredicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the\ngenerative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to\ngeneralize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate\nMIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up\nto 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST\n2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box\nMulti-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%). These results demonstrate that our\nmethod can uncover substantial membership leakage in synthetic tabular data,\nchallenging the assumption that synthetic data is inherently\nprivacy-preserving.

Among them is the SLH-DSA that was recently standardized by NIST\nand is favored for its conservative security foundations.\n  In this work, we present the first software-only universal forgery attack on\nSLH-DSA, leveraging Rowhammer-induced bit flips to corrupt the internal state\nand forge signatures. While prior work targeted embedded systems and required\nphysical access, our attack is software-only, targeting commodity desktop and\nserver hardware, significantly broadening the threat model. We demonstrate a\nfull end-to-end attack against all security levels of SLH-DSA in OpenSSL 3.5.1,\nachieving universal forgery for the highest security level after eight hours of\nhammering and 36 seconds of post-processing. Our post-processing is informed by\na novel complexity analysis that, given a concrete set of faulty signatures,\nidentifies the most promising computational path to pursue.\n  To enable the attack, we introduce Swage, a modular and extensible framework\nfor implementing end-to-end Rowhammer-based fault attacks. Swage abstracts and\nautomates key components of practical Rowhammer attacks. Unlike prior tooling,\nSwage is untangled from the attacked code, making it reusable and suitable for\nfrictionless analysis of different targets. Our findings highlight that even\ntheoretically sound PQC schemes can fail under real-world conditions,\nunderscoring the need for additional implementation hardening or hardware\ndefenses against Rowhammer."}

To this end,\na multi-angled framework is proposed in this article in order to define and\nassess digital sovereign control of data and AI-based models for military cyber\nsecurity. This framework focuses on aspects such as context, autonomy,\nstakeholder involvement, and mitigation of risks in this domain. Grounded on\nthe concepts of digital sovereignty and data sovereignty, the framework aims to\nprotect sensitive defence assets against threats such as unauthorized access,\nransomware, and supply-chain attacks. This approach reflects the multifaceted\nnature of digital sovereignty by preserving operational autonomy, assuring\nsecurity and safety, securing privacy, and fostering ethical compliance of both\nmilitary systems and decision-makers. At the same time, the framework addresses\ninteroperability challenges among allied forces, strategic and legal\nconsiderations, and the integration of emerging technologies by considering a\nmultidisciplinary approach that enhances the resilience and preservation of\ncontrol over (critical) digital assets. This is done by adopting a design\noriented research where systematic literature review is merged with critical\nthinking and analysis of field incidents in order to assure the effectivity and\nrealism of the framework proposed."}

Phishers achieve this scale by using phishing kits -- ready-to-deploy\nphishing websites -- to rapidly deploy phishing campaigns with specific data\nexfiltration, evasion, or mimicry techniques. In contrast, researchers and\ndefenders continue to fight phishing on a page-by-page basis and rely on manual\nanalysis to recognize static features for kit identification.\n  This paper aims to aid researchers and analysts by automatically\ndifferentiating groups of phishing pages based on the underlying kit,\nautomating a previously manual process, and enabling us to measure how popular\ndifferent client-side techniques are across these groups. For kit detection,\nour system has an accuracy of 97% on a ground-truth dataset of 548 kit families\ndeployed across 4,562 phishing URLs. On an unlabeled dataset, we leverage the\ncomplexity of 434,050 phishing pages' JavaScript logic to group them into\n11,377 clusters, annotating the clusters with what phishing techniques they\nemploy. We find that UI interactivity and basic fingerprinting are universal\ntechniques, present in 90% and 80% of the clusters, respectively.

However, enterprise and\nregulated software vendors commonly wish to restrict who can view confidential\nsoftware metadata recorded in their SBOMs due to intellectual property or\nsecurity vulnerability information. To address this tension between\ntransparency and confidentiality, we propose Petra, an SBOM exchange system\nthat empowers software vendors to interoperably compose and distribute redacted\nSBOM data using selective encryption. Petra enables software consumers to\nsearch redacted SBOMs for answers to specific security questions without\nrevealing information they are not authorized to access. Petra leverages a\nformat-agnostic, tamper-evident SBOM representation to generate efficient and\nconfidentiality-preserving integrity proofs, allowing interested parties to\ncryptographically audit and establish trust in redacted SBOMs. Exchanging\nredacted SBOMs in our Petra prototype requires less than 1 extra KB per SBOM,\nand SBOM decryption account for at most 1% of the performance overhead during\nan SBOM query."}

LLMs are the AI models that are the power house behind generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. These AI models, fueled by vast amounts of data and computational prowess, have unlocked remarkable capabilities, from human-like text generation to assisting with natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. They have quickly become the foundation upon which countless applications and software services are being built, or at least being augmented with. However, as with any groundbreaking innovations, the rise of LLMs brings forth critical safety, privacy, and ethical concerns. These models are found to have a propensity to leak private information, produce false information, and can be coerced into generating content that can be used for nefarious purposes by bad actors, or even by regular users unknowingly. Implementing safeguards and guardrailing techniques is imperative for applications to ensure that the content generated by LLMs are safe, secure, and ethical. Thus, frameworks to deploy mechanisms that prevent misuse of these models via application implementations is imperative. In this study, wepropose a Flexible Adaptive Sequencing mechanism with trust and safety modules, that can be used to implement safety guardrails for the development and deployment of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e8f\u5217\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5f00\u53d1\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u5e26\u6765\u9769\u547d\u6027AI\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6cc4\u9732\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u4ea7\u751f\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u5229\u7528\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u5408\u4e4e\u4f26\u7406", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlexible Adaptive Sequencing\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5e94\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd", "result": "\u672a\u5728\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u8bf4\u660e\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65bdLLM\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u673a\u5236", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u9632\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u9632\u6b62LLM\u7684\u6ee5\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e8f\u5217\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848"}}

Under review", "summary": "Network defenders face a steady stream of attacks, observed as raw Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts. The sheer volume of alerts demands prioritization, typically based on high-level risk classifications. This work expands the scope of risk measurement by examining alerts not only through their technical characteristics but also by examining and classifying their temporal patterns. One critical issue in responding to intrusion alerts is determining whether an alert is part of an escalating attack pattern or an opportunistic scan. To identify the former, we apply extreme-regime forecasting methods from financial modeling to IDS data. Extreme-regime forecasting is designed to identify likely future high-impact events or significant shifts in system behavior. Using these methods, we examine attack patterns by computing per-minute alert intensity, volatility, and a short-term momentum measure derived from weighted moving averages.\n  We evaluate the efficacy of a supervised learning model for forecasting future escalation patterns using these derived features. The trained model identifies future high-intensity attacks and demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving approximately 91\\% accuracy, 89\\% recall, and 98\\% precision. Our contributions provide a temporal measurement framework for identifying future high-intensity attacks and demonstrate the presence of predictive early-warning signals within the temporal structure of IDS alert streams. We describe our methods in sufficient detail to enable reproduction using other IDS datasets. In addition, we make the trained models openly available to support further research.

Nevertheless, current IoT IDS systems are usually traded off with detection quality, model elucidability, and computational effectiveness, thus the deployment on IoT devices. The present paper counteracts these difficulties by suggesting an explainable AI (XAI) framework based on an optimized Decision Tree classifier with both local and global importance methods: SHAP values that estimate feature attribution using local explanations, and Morris sensitivity analysis that identifies the feature importance in a global view. The proposed system attains the state of art on the test performance with 99.91% accuracy, F1-score of 99.51% and Cohen Kappa of 0.9960 and high stability is confirmed by a cross validation mean accuracy of 98.93%. Efficiency is also enhanced in terms of computations to provide faster inferences compared to those that are generalized in ensemble models. SrcMac has shown as the most significant predictor in feature analyses according to SHAP and Morris methods. Compared to the previous work, our solution eliminates its major drawback lack because it allows us to apply it to edge devices and, therefore, achieve real-time processing, adhere to the new regulation of transparency in AI, and achieve high detection rates on attacks of dissimilar classes.

Trained on 1,000 out-of-distribution Alpaca instructions (<0.5% trainable parameters), CORVUS transfers to FAVA-Annotation across Llama-2, Vicuna, Llama-3, and Qwen2.5, and degrades both training-free detectors (e.g., LLM-Check) and probe-based detectors (e.g., SEP, ICR-probe), motivating adversary-aware auditing that incorporates external grounding or cross-model evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "CORVUS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6765\u4f2a\u88c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u9065\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5355\u901a\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u901a\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56LLM\u5185\u90e8\u9065\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f1a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u7559\u4e0b\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u75d5\u8ff9\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u767d\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u4fa7\u5bf9\u6297\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6765\u9690\u85cf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u75d5\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCORVUS\u9ad8\u6548\u7ea2\u961f\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u56fa\u5b9a\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u6559\u5e08\u5f3a\u5236\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4f2a\u88c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u9065\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684FGSM\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u57281000\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5916Alpaca\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08<0.5%\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0cCORVUS\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230Llama-2\u3001Vicuna\u3001Llama-3\u3001Qwen2.5\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7684FAVA-Annotation\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08\u5982LLM-Check\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08\u5982SEP\u3001ICR-probe\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CORVUS\u653b\u51fb\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5355\u901a\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5bf9\u6297\u8005\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u57fa\u7840\u6216\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8bc1\u636e\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We identify a fundamental security flaw in modern VLA systems: the combination of action chunking and delta pose representations creates an intra-chunk visual open-loop. This mechanism forces the robot to execute K-step action sequences, allowing per-step perturbations to accumulate through integration. We propose SILENTDRIFT, a stealthy black-box backdoor attack exploiting this vulnerability. Our method employs the Smootherstep function to construct perturbations with guaranteed C2 continuity, ensuring zero velocity and acceleration at trajectory boundaries to satisfy strict kinematic consistency constraints. Furthermore, our keyframe attack strategy selectively poisons only the critical approach phase, maximizing impact while minimizing trigger exposure. The resulting poisoned trajectories are visually indistinguishable from successful demonstrations.

This growing ecosystem also raises supply-chain risks, where adversaries can distribute poisoned models that degrade downstream reliability and user trust. Existing backdoor attacks and defenses are largely prompt-centric, focusing on user-visible triggers while overlooking structural signals in multi-turn conversations. We propose Turn-based Structural Trigger (TST), a backdoor attack that activates from dialogue structure, using the turn index as the trigger and remaining independent of user inputs. Across four widely used open-source LLM models, TST achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 99.52% with minimal utility degradation, and remains effective under five representative defenses with an average ASR of 98.04%. The attack also generalizes well across instruction datasets, maintaining an average ASR of 99.19%. Our results suggest that dialogue structure constitutes an important and under-studied attack surface for multi-turn LLM systems, motivating structure-aware auditing and mitigation in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5TST\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u7d22\u5f15\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bddLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u7ed5\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u52a9\u624b\u7b49\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u98ce\u9669\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8fd9\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTurn-based Structural Trigger (TST)\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u7d22\u5f15\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u5185\u5bb9\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "TST\u5728\u56db\u4e2aLLM\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u523099.52%\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5c0f\u3002\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u630198.04%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747ASR\u4e3a99.19%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u591a\u8f6eLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u4e14\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u662f\u4e0d\u591f\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8003\u8651\u3002"}}

Leveraging Generative AI through On-Device Large Language Models (ODLLMs) provides a viable solution for real-time threat detection at the network edge, though limited computational resources present challenges for smaller ODLLMs. This paper introduces a novel detection framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tailored specifically for IoT edge environments. We systematically evaluate compact ODLLMs, including LLaMA 3.2 (1B, 3B) and Gemma 3 (1B, 4B), using structured prompting and exemplar-driven reasoning strategies. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements with few-shot prompting, achieving macro-average F1 scores as high as 0.85. Our findings highlight the significant advantages of incorporating exemplar-based reasoning, underscoring that CoT and RAG approaches markedly enhance small ODLLMs' capabilities in accurately classifying complex network attacks under stringent resource constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8fb9\u7f18DDoS\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c0f\u578b\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5c55\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u62d2\u7edd\u670d\u52a1\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\u3002\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u8fb9\u7f18\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ecLLaMA 3.2\u76841B\u548c3B\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caGemma 3\u76841B\u548c4B\u7248\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe0.85\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u6570\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u660e\u663e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5c0f\u578b\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The paper also highlights key threat vectors, including Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming/spoofing, ATC radio frequency misuse, attacks on TCAS and ADS-B, possible backdoor via Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), new vulnerabilities introduced by aircraft automation and connectivity, and risks from flight management system (FMS) software, database and cloud services. Finally, this paper describes emerging defense techniques against these attacks, and open technical problems to address toward better defense mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\uff08AAM\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662feVTOL\u98de\u673a\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u672a\u6765AAM\u751f\u6001\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5148\u8fdb\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\uff08AAM\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7535\u52a8\u5782\u76f4\u8d77\u964d\uff08eVTOL\uff09\u98de\u673a\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u4e92\u8054\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5546\u4e1a\u822a\u7a7a\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5206\u6790AAM\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\u822a\u7a7a\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8c03\u67e5\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u6790\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u672a\u6765AAM\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff1b4\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5a01\u80c1\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u65b0\u5174\u9632\u5fa1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86AAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5a01\u80c1\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ecGPS\u5e72\u6270/\u6b3a\u9a97\u3001ATC\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u9891\u7387\u6ee5\u7528\u3001TCAS\u548cADS-B\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5b50\u98de\u884c\u5305\uff08EFB\uff09\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u3001\u98de\u673a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u65b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3001\u98de\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6/\u6570\u636e\u5e93/\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "AAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b0\u5174\u9632\u5fa1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5f00\u653e\u6280\u672f\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u672a\u6765\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Based on a broader, more grounded understanding of the term, in we identify several issues in the design of OpenID4VCI and OpenID4VP: insecure practices, static, and subject-bound credential types, and a limited query language restrict their application to classic scenarios of credential exchange -- already supported by existing solutions like OpenID Connect, SIOPv2, OIDC4IDA, and OIDC Claims Aggregation -- barring dynamic, asynchronous, or automated use cases. We also debunk OpenID's 'paradigm-shifting' trust-model, which -- when compared to existing decentralized alternatives -- does not deliver any significant increase in control, privacy, and portability of personal information. Not only the technical choices limit the capabilities of the EUDI framework; also the legislation itself cannot accommodate the promise of self-sovereign identity. In particular, we criticize the introduction of institutionalized trusted lists, and discuss their economical and political risks. Their potential to decline into an exclusory, re-centralized ecosystem endangers the vision of a user-oriented identity management in which individuals are in charge. Instead, the consequences might severely restrict people in what they can do with their personal information, and risk increased linkability and monitoring. In anticipation of revisions to the EUDI regulations, we suggest several technical alternatives that overcome some of the issues with the architecture of OpenID. In particular, OAuth's UMA extension and its A4DS profile, as well as their integration in GNAP, are worth looking into.

Due to this prevailing belief, the possibility of (maliciously) perturbed benign packets being misclassified as attack has been largely ignored. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is not only theoretically possible, but also a particular threat to NIDS. In particular, we uncover a practical cyberattack, FPR manipulation attack (FPA), especially targeting industrial IoT networks, where domain-specific knowledge of the widely used MQTT protocol is exploited and a systematic simple packet-level perturbation is performed to alter the labels of benign traffic samples without employing traditional gradient-based or non-gradient-based methods. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that this novel attack results in a success rate of 80.19% to 100%. In addition, while estimating impacts in the Security Operations Center, we observe that even a small fraction of false positive alerts, irrespective of different budget constraints and alert traffic intensities, can increase the delay of genuine alerts investigations up to 2 hr in a single day under normal operating conditions. Furthermore, a series of relevant statistical and XAI analyses is conducted to understand the key factors behind this remarkable success. Finally, we explore the effectiveness of the FPA packets to enhance models' robustness through adversarial training and investigate the changes in decision boundaries accordingly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u2014\u2014FPR\u64cd\u7eb5\u653b\u51fb(FPA)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528MQTT\u534f\u8bae\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5305\u8fdb\u884c\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u88ab\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe80.19%-100%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8b66\u62a5\u8c03\u67e5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u653b\u51fb\u5305\u88ab\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u826f\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u826f\u6027\u5305\u88ab\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u79cd\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u5fc3\u88ab\u5927\u91cf\u865a\u5047\u8b66\u62a5\u6df9\u6ca1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFPR\u64cd\u7eb5\u653b\u51fb(FPA)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684MQTT\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5305\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5305\u7ea7\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u6216\u975e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u5206\u6790\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u523080.19%\u81f3100%\u3002\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u5fc3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c11\u91cf\u865a\u5047\u9633\u6027\u8b66\u62a5\u4e5f\u4f1a\u4f7f\u771f\u5b9e\u8b66\u62a5\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u6700\u591a2\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\u653b\u51fb\u5305\u8fd8\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FPR\u64cd\u7eb5\u653b\u51fb\u662f\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u53cc\u5411\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Assembly Flow Graph (AFG) to comprehensively represent the assembly flow of a binary executable as graph data.

However, since AFGs may be large in practice, we also propose a Meta-Coarsening approach to improve computational tractability via graph reduction. To evaluate our proposed approach we consider several novel and existing metrics to quantify the granularity and quality of explanations. Lastly, we also consider several hyperparameters in our proposed Meta-Coarsening approach that can be used to control the final explanation size. We evaluate our proposed approach using the CIC-DGG-2025 dataset. Our results indicate that our proposed AFG and Meta-Coarsening approach can provide both increased explainability and inference performance at certain coarsening levels.

AI agents are being adopted across digital forensic practices due to their ability to automate processes such as anomaly detection, evidence classification, and behavioral pattern recognition, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing investigation timelines. However, the characteristics that make AI indispensable also introduce notable risks. AI systems, often trained on biased or incomplete datasets, can produce misleading results, including false positives and false negatives, thereby jeopardizing the integrity of forensic investigations. This study presents a meticulous comparative analysis of the effectiveness of the most used AI agent, ChatGPT, and human forensic investigators in the realm of cyber forensic analysis. Our research reveals critical limitations within AI-driven approaches, demonstrating scenarios in which sophisticated or novel cyber threats remain undetected due to the rigid pattern-based nature of AI systems. Conversely, our analysis highlights the crucial role that human forensic investigators play in mitigating these risks. Through adaptive decision-making, ethical reasoning, and contextual understanding, human investigators effectively identify subtle anomalies and threats that may evade automated detection systems. To reinforce our findings, we conducted comprehensive reliability testing of forensic techniques using multiple cyber threat scenarios. These tests confirmed that while AI agents significantly improve the efficiency of routine analyses, human oversight remains crucial in ensuring accuracy and comprehensiveness of the results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86AI\u4ee3\u7406\uff08ChatGPT\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u53d6\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AI\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5e38\u89c4\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6216\u65b0\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u53d6\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u54cd\u5e94\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002AI\u4ee3\u7406\u867d\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u5206\u7c7b\u7b49\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u504f\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u53d6\u8bc1\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u5e38\u7528AI\u4ee3\u7406ChatGPT\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d6\u8bc1\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u53d6\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522bAI\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6216\u65b0\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5a01\u80c1\u6f0f\u68c0\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136AI\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e38\u89c4\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5168\u9762\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002AI\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408AI\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The lack of a clear definition in managing shared and protected access to IoT sensors offer channels by which devices can be compromised and sensitive data can be leaked. In recent years, WebAssembly has received considerable attention for its efficient application sandboxing suitable for embedded systems, making it a prime candidate for exploring a secure and portable sensor interface. This paper introduces the first WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) extension offering a secure, portable, and low-footprint sandbox enabling multi-tenant access to sensor data across heterogeneous embedded devices. The runtime extensions provide application memory isolation, ensure appropriate resource privileges by intercepting sensor access, and offer an MQTT-SN interface enabling in-network access control. When targeting the WebAssembly byte-code with the associated runtime extensions implemented atop the Zephyr RTOS, our evaluation of sensor access indicates a latency overhead of 6% with an additional memory footprint of 5% when compared to native execution. As MQTT-SN requests are dominated by network delays, the WASI-SN implementation of MQTT-SN introduces less than 1% additional latency with similar memory footprint.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2aWASI\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u6c99\u7bb1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79df\u6237\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7WebAssembly\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5b58\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6743\u9650\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u666e\u53ca\u5e26\u6765\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bbf\u95ee\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bbe\u5907\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u3002WebAssembly\u56e0\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6c99\u7bb1\u7279\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u5b89\u5168\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9996\u4e2aWASI\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u6c99\u7bb1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5e94\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u9694\u79bb\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bbf\u95ee\u62e6\u622a\u786e\u4fdd\u8d44\u6e90\u6743\u9650\u3001MQTT-SN\u63a5\u53e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5728Zephyr RTOS\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9WebAssembly\u5b57\u8282\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bbf\u95ee\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\u4e3a6%\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u4e3a5%\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u751f\u6267\u884c\uff09\u3002MQTT-SN\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f15\u5165\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\u7684\u989d\u5916\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684WASI\u6269\u5c55\u6210\u529f\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u591a\u79df\u6237\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u6c99\u7bb1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86WebAssembly\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we set out to address this pain point by proposing Restricter, which automatically tightens each (permit) policy rule of a policy with respect to an access log, which captures some already exercised access requests and their corresponding access decisions (i.e., allow or deny). Restricter achieves policy tightening by reducing the number of access requests permitted by a policy rule without sacrificing the functionality of the underlying system it is regulating.

However, this automation is a double-edged sword: a single misconfiguration in IaC scripts can propagate widely, leading to severe system downtime and security risks. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain security smells--bad coding patterns that may introduce vulnerabilities--and have proposed static analyzers based on symbolic rules to detect them. Yet, our preliminary analysis reveals that rule-based detection alone tends to over-approximate, producing excessive false positives and increasing the burden of manual inspection. In this paper, we present IntelliSA, an intelligent static analyzer for IaC security smell detection that integrates symbolic rules with neural inference. IntelliSA applies symbolic rules to over-approximate potential smells for broad coverage, then employs neural inference to filter false positives. While an LLM can effectively perform this filtering, reliance on LLM APIs introduces high cost and latency, raises data governance concerns, and limits reproducibility and offline deployment. To address the challenges, we adopt a knowledge distillation approach: an LLM teacher generates pseudo-labels to train a compact student model--over 500x smaller--that learns from the teacher's knowledge and efficiently classifies false positives.

Modern cloud-native DDoS attacks further evolve rapidly and often blend multi-vector strategies, creating an operational dilemma: defenders need wire-speed monitoring while also requiring explainable, auditable attribution for response. Existing rule-based and supervised-learning approaches typically output black-box scores or labels, provide limited evidence chains, and generalize poorly to unseen attack variants; meanwhile, high-quality labeled data is often difficult to obtain in cloud settings.\n  We present Holmes (DDoS Detective), an LLM-based DDoS detection agent that reframes the model as a virtual SRE investigator rather than an end-to-end classifier. Holmes couples a funnel-like hierarchical workflow (counters/sFlow for continuous sensing and triage; PCAP evidence collection triggered only on anomaly windows) with an Evidence Pack abstraction that converts binary packets into compact, reproducible, high-signal structured evidence. On top of this evidence interface, Holmes enforces a structure-first investigation protocol and strict JSON/quotation constraints to produce machine-consumable reports with auditable evidence anchors.\n  We evaluate Holmes on CICDDoS2019 reflection/amplification attacks and script-triggered flooding scenarios. Results show that Holmes produces attribution decisions grounded in salient evidence anchors across diverse attack families, and when errors occur, its audit logs make the failure source easy to localize, demonstrating the practicality of an LLM agent for cost-controlled and traceable DDoS investigation in cloud operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Holmes\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684DDoS\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u865a\u62dfSRE\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u5305\u62bd\u8c61\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684DDoS\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u9762\u4e34\u9891\u7e41\u7684DDoS\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e91\u539f\u751fDDoS\u653b\u51fb\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u8fdb\u4e14\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f93\u51fa\u9ed1\u76d2\u5206\u6570\u6216\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8bc1\u636e\u94fe\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u653b\u51fb\u53d8\u4f53\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "method": "1) \u6f0f\u6597\u5f0f\u5206\u5c42\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba1\u6570\u5668/sFlow\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u7a97\u53e3\u89e6\u53d1PCAP\u8bc1\u636e\u6536\u96c6\uff1b2) \u8bc1\u636e\u5305\u62bd\u8c61\uff1a\u5c06\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6570\u636e\u5305\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u3001\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b3) \u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5148\u8c03\u67e5\u534f\u8bae\uff1a\u5f3a\u5236JSON/\u5f15\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u6709\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8bc1\u636e\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u6d88\u8d39\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "result": "\u5728CICDDoS2019\u53cd\u5c04/\u653e\u5927\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u811a\u672c\u89e6\u53d1\u6d2a\u6c34\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cHolmes\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u8457\u8bc1\u636e\u951a\u70b9\u505a\u51fa\u5f52\u56e0\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5f53\u9519\u8bef\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65e5\u5fd7\u4f7f\u6545\u969c\u6e90\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e91\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684DDoS\u8c03\u67e5\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Holmes\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u865a\u62dfSRE\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\u5728\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884cDDoS\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e91\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Whaling is a form of social engineering that targets important high-authority individuals within organizations and uses sophisticated fraudulent emails. In the context of Japanese universities, faculty members frequently hold positions that combine research leadership with authority within institutional workflows. This structural characteristic leads to the wide public disclosure of high-value information such as publications, grants, and detailed researcher profiles. Such extensive information exposure enables the construction of highly precise target profiles using generative AI. This raises concerns that Whaling attacks based on high-precision profiling by generative AI will become prevalent. In this study, we propose a Whaling countermeasure framework for university faculty members that constructs personalized defense profiles and uses large language model (LLM)-based agents. We design agents that (i) build vulnerability profiles for each target from publicly available information on faculty members, (ii) identify potential risk scenarios relevant to Whaling defense based on those profiles, (iii) construct defense profiles corresponding to the vulnerabilities and anticipated risks, and (iv) analyze Whaling emails using the defense profiles. Furthermore, we conduct a preliminary risk-assessment experiment. The results indicate that the proposed method can produce judgments accompanied by explanations of response policies that are consistent with the work context of faculty members who are Whaling targets. The findings also highlight practical challenges and considerations for future operational deployment and systematic evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u5b66\u6559\u804c\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u9cb8\u9493\u653b\u51fb\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9632\u5fa1\u6863\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5f00\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6790\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u9669", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6821\u6559\u804c\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u9cb8\u9493\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5458\u5de5\u901a\u5e38\u517c\u5177\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u548c\u884c\u653f\u6743\u5a01\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88abAI\u6784\u5efa\u7cbe\u51c6\u653b\u51fb\u753b\u50cf", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a1)\u4ece\u516c\u5f00\u4fe1\u606f\u6784\u5efa\u6559\u804c\u5458\u5de5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6863\u6848\uff1b2)\u8bc6\u522b\u9cb8\u9493\u9632\u5fa1\u76f8\u5173\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\uff1b3)\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u5e94\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6863\u6848\uff1b4)\u4f7f\u7528\u9632\u5fa1\u6863\u6848\u5206\u6790\u9cb8\u9493\u90ae\u4ef6", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u6559\u804c\u5458\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u60c5\u5883\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6311\u6218", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u5b66\u6559\u804c\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u9cb8\u9493\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6311\u6218"}}

Indeed, existing defenses rely on LLM-mediated checking stages that add substantial latency and cost, and that can be undermined in multi-turn interactions through manipulation or benign-looking conversational scaffolding. Contrasting this background, this paper makes a key observation: internal representations associated with privacy-violating intent can be separated from benign requests using linear structure. Using this insight, the paper proposes NeuroFilter, a guardrail framework that operationalizes contextual integrity by mapping norm violations to simple directions in the model's activation space, enabling detection even when semantic filters are bypassed. The proposed filter is also extended to capture threats arising during long conversations using the concept of activation velocity, which measures cumulative drift in internal representations across turns. A comprehensive evaluation across over 150,000 interactions and covering models from 7B to 70B parameters, illustrates the strong performance of NeuroFilter in detecting privacy attacks while maintaining zero false positives on benign prompts, all while reducing the computational inference cost by several orders of magnitude when compared to LLM-based agentic privacy defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroFilter\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u68c0\u6d4b\u9690\u79c1\u8fdd\u89c4\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u62a4\u680f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u901f\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u96f6\u8bef\u62a5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3001\u6210\u672c\u5927\u3001\u6613\u88ab\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u64cd\u7eb5\u7ed5\u8fc7\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9690\u79c1\u8fdd\u89c4\u610f\u56fe\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u89c4\u8303\u8fdd\u89c4\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u901f\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u6f02\u79fb\u5a01\u80c1", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u8fc715\u4e07\u6b21\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c7B\u523070B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cNeuroFilter\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u826f\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u96f6\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7", "conclusion": "NeuroFilter\u4e3a\u667a\u80fdLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500"}}

However, due to the characteristic of sequential generation of ARMs, the stegotext generated by ARM-based PSLS methods will produce serious error propagation once it changes, making existing methods unavailable under an active tampering attack. To address this, we propose a robust, provably secure linguistic steganography with diffusion language models (DLMs). Unlike ARMs, DLMs can generate text in a partially parallel manner, allowing us to find robust positions for steganographic embedding that can be combined with error-correcting codes. Furthermore, we introduce error correction strategies, including pseudo-random error correction and neighborhood search correction, during steganographic extraction. Theoretical proof and experimental results demonstrate that our method is secure and robust. It can resist token ambiguity in stegotext segmentation and, to some extent, withstand token-level attacks of insertion, deletion, and substitution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u9690\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u6297\u4e3b\u52a8\u7be1\u6539\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u9690\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u88ab\u7be1\u6539\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u62b5\u6297\u4e3b\u52a8\u7be1\u6539\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u90e8\u5206\u5e76\u884c\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9690\u5199\u5d4c\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\uff1b\u5728\u9690\u5199\u63d0\u53d6\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u7ea0\u9519\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u641c\u7d22\u7ea0\u9519\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u6297\u9690\u5199\u6587\u672c\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u62b5\u6297\u63d2\u5165\u3001\u5220\u9664\u548c\u66ff\u6362\u7b49\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u9690\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u62b5\u6297\u4e3b\u52a8\u7be1\u6539\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This threat is necessitating a transition to quantum resistant cryptographic alternatives in all the applications. In this work, we present the implementation of a practical hybrid end-to-end encryption system that combines classical and post-quantum cryptographic primitives to achieve both security and efficiency. Our system employs CRYSTALS-Kyber, a NIST-standardized lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism, for quantum-safe key exchange, coupled with AES-256-GCM for efficient authenticated symmetric encryption and SHA-256 for deterministic key derivation. The architecture follows a zero-trust model where a relay server facilitates communication without accessing plaintext messages or cryptographic keys.

Instead, the user community opted to rely on more practical but ad-hoc solutions (such as Mempool.space) that aim at detecting censorship and transaction displacement attacks by auditing discrepancies in the mempools of so-called observers.\n  In this paper, we precisely analyze, for the first time, the interplay between mempool auditing and the ability to detect censorship and transaction displacement attacks by malicious miners in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our analysis shows that mempool auditing can result in mis-accusations against miners with a probability larger than 25% in some settings. On a positive note, however, we show that mempool auditing schemes can successfully audit the execution of any two transactions (with an overwhelming probability of 99.9%) if they are consistently received by all observers and sent at least 30 seconds apart from each other. As a direct consequence, our findings show, for the first time, that batch-order fair-ordering schemes can offer only strong fairness guarantees for a limited subset of transactions in real-world deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u548c\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u64cd\u7eb5\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u6307\u63a7\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u4ea4\u6613\u95f4\u969430\u79d2\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4ea4\u6613\u6267\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u9632\u5fa1\u4ea4\u6613\u64cd\u7eb5\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u672a\u88ab\u4e3b\u6d41\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u793e\u533a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7b49\u5b9e\u7528\u4f46\u4e34\u65f6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u77ff\u5de5\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u548c\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u4e2d\u6076\u610f\u77ff\u5de5\u53d1\u8d77\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u7f6e\u6362\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u77ff\u5de5\u7684\u8bef\u6307\u63a7\u6982\u7387\u8d85\u8fc725%\u3002\u4f46\u82e5\u4ea4\u6613\u88ab\u6240\u6709\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u63a5\u6536\u4e14\u53d1\u9001\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u81f3\u5c1130\u79d2\uff0c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u4ee599.9%\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6210\u529f\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u6267\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6279\u91cf\u987a\u5e8f\u516c\u5e73\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u53ea\u80fd\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u5b50\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u5ba1\u8ba1\u867d\u7136\u5b9e\u7528\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While effective to some extent, these methods often still leak high-level information such as class distributions or feature representations, and are frequently broken by increasingly powerful denoising attacks. We propose a fundamentally different perspective on FL defense: framing it as a spoofing problem.We introduce SpooFL (Figure 1), a spoofing-based defense that deceives attackers into believing they have recovered the true training data, while actually providing convincing but entirely synthetic samples from an unrelated task. Unlike prior synthetic-data defenses that share classes or distributions with the private data and thus still leak semantic information, SpooFL uses a state-of-the-art generative model trained on an external dataset with no class overlap. As a result, attackers are misled into recovering plausible yet completely irrelevant samples, preventing meaningful data leakage while preserving FL training integrity. We implement the first example of such a spoofing defense, and evaluate our method against state-of-the-art DL defenses and demonstrate that it successfully misdirects attackers without compromising model performance significantly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSpooFL\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b3a\u9a97\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u6765\u8bef\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\u8005\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u6216\u52a0\u5bc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6dfb\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u53d8\u6362\u6216\u52a0\u5bc6\uff09\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4f1a\u6cc4\u9732\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u6216\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u653b\u51fb\u7834\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\u5316\u4e3a\u6b3a\u9a97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4e0e\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u7c7b\u522b\u91cd\u53e0\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bef\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6062\u590d\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "SpooFL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9632\u5fa1\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b3a\u9a97\u800c\u975e\u6df7\u6dc6\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cc4\u9732\u653b\u51fb\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Classical machine learning (ML) models such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine perform well on known attacks but require retraining to detect unseen or zero-day threats. This study investigates lightweight decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) for IoT attack detection by integrating structured-to-text conversion, Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) fine-tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Network traffic features are transformed into compact natural-language prompts, enabling efficient adaptation under constrained hardware. Experiments on the CICIoT2023 dataset show that a QLoRA-tuned LLaMA-1B model achieves an F1-score of 0.7124, comparable to the Random Forest (RF) baseline (0.7159) for known attacks. With RAG, the system attains 42.63% accuracy on unseen attack types without additional training, demonstrating practical zero-shot capability. These results highlight the potential of retrieval-enhanced lightweight LLMs as adaptable and resource-efficient solutions for next-generation IoT intrusion detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u5668LLM\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\u3001QLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u548cRAG\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u7ecf\u5178\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5df2\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u624d\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u672a\u77e5\u6216\u96f6\u65e5\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u5668LLM\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\uff08\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u3001QLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u91cf\u5316\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff09\u548cRAG\uff08\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728CICIoT2023\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cQLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLaMA-1B\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5df2\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u52300.7124\uff0c\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u57fa\u7ebf\uff080.7159\uff09\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u4f7f\u7528RAG\u540e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u8fbe\u523042.63%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LLM\u5177\u6709\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Informed by this framework, we reveal system-level vulnerabilities across both physical and digital domains, designing physical denial-of-service and digital forgery attacks to disrupt proper authentication. The effectiveness of the designed attacks underscores the strong need for security countermeasures for reliable and resilient authentication based on paper PUFs.

This system enables DNA synthesizers to screen order requests against a database of hazards. By applying novel cryptography, the system aims to keep order requests and the database of hazards secret. Discerning the detailed operation of the system in part from source code (Version 1.0.8), our analysis examines key management, certificate infrastructure, authentication, and rate-limiting mechanisms. We also perform the first formal-methods analysis of the mutual authentication, basic request, and exemption-handling protocols.\n  Without breaking the cryptography, our main finding is that SecureDNA's custom mutual authentication protocol SCEP achieves only one-way authentication: the hazards database and keyservers never learn with whom they communicate. This structural weakness violates the principle of defense in depth and enables an adversary to circumvent rate limits that protect the secrecy of the hazards database, if the synthesizer connects with a malicious or corrupted keyserver or hashed database. We point out an additional structural weakness that also violates the principle of defense in depth: inadequate cryptographic bindings prevent the system from detecting if responses, within a TLS channel, from the hazards database were modified. Consequently, if a synthesizer were to reconnect with the database over the same TLS session, an adversary could replay and swap responses from the database without breaking TLS. Although the SecureDNA implementation does not allow such reconnections, it would be stronger security engineering to avoid the underlying structural weakness. We identify these vulnerabilities and suggest and verify mitigations, including adding strong bindings.

Designing detectors for filtering is an effective defense method, but most detectors will be compromised by adversarial samples. Currently, most studies exposing AIGC security issues assume information on model structure and data distribution. In real applications, attackers query and interfere with models that provide services in the form of application programming interfaces (APIs), which constitutes the black-box decision-based attack paradigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, decision-based attacks on AIGC detectors remain unexplored. In this study, we propose \\textbf{FBA$^2$D}: a frequency-based black-box attack method for AIGC detection to fill the research gap. Motivated by frequency-domain discrepancies between generated and real images, we develop a decision-based attack that leverages the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for fine-grained spectral partitioning and selects frequency bands as query subspaces, improving both query efficiency and image quality. Moreover, attacks on AIGC detectors should mitigate initialization failures, preserve image quality, and operate under strict query budgets.

In many applications and agents, the input data originates from multiple sources, with each source contributing a segment of the overall input. In these multi-source scenarios, an attacker may control only a subset of the sources and contaminate the corresponding segments, but typically does not know the order in which the segments are arranged within the input. Existing prompt injection attacks either assume that the entire input data comes from a single source under the attacker's control or ignore the uncertainty in the ordering of segments from different sources. As a result, their success is limited in domains involving multi-source data.\n  In this work, we propose ObliInjection, the first prompt injection attack targeting LLM applications and agents with multi-source input data. ObliInjection introduces two key technical innovations: the order-oblivious loss, which quantifies the likelihood that the LLM will complete the attacker-chosen task regardless of how the clean and contaminated segments are ordered; and the orderGCG algorithm, which is tailored to minimize the order-oblivious loss and optimize the contaminated segments.

While machine-learning-based methods have shown some promise, many still rely on rule-based preprocessing designed by domain experts. Rule-based preprocessing methods often discard crucial context from the source code, potentially causing certain vulnerabilities to be overlooked and limiting adaptability to newly emerging threats. We introduce BugSweeper, an end-to-end deep learning framework that detects vulnerabilities directly from the source code without manual engineering. BugSweeper represents each Solidity function as a Function-Level Abstract Syntax Graph (FLAG), a novel graph that combines its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with enriched control-flow and data-flow semantics. Then, our two-stage Graph Neural Network (GNN) analyzes these graphs. The first-stage GNN filters noise from the syntax graphs, while the second-stage GNN conducts high-level reasoning to detect diverse vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on real-world contracts show that BugSweeper significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art detection methods.

Validators operate inside heterogeneous VM-based TEEs, each running the same canonical program whose measurement is publicly recorded, and each producing vendor-backed attestations that bind the enclave code hash to the block contents. Because the execution is deterministic and the proposer is uniquely derived from public randomness, PoTE avoids forks, eliminates slot.time bottlenecks, and commits blocks in a single round of verification.

Recent studies have revealed that recommender systems are prone to membership inference attacks (MIAs), where an attacker aims to infer whether or not a user's data has been used for training a target recommender system. However, existing MIAs fail to exploit the unique characteristic of recommender systems, and therefore are only applicable to mixed recommender systems consisting of two recommendation algorithms. This leaves a gap in investigating MIAs against hybrid-based recommender systems where the same algorithm utilizing user-item historical interactions and attributes of users and items serves and produces personalised recommendations. To investigate how the personalisation in hybrid-based recommender systems influences MIA, we propose a novel metric-based MIA. Specifically, we leverage the characteristic of personalisation to obtain reference recommendation for any target users. Then, a relative membership metric is proposed to exploit a target user's historical interactions, target recommendation, and reference recommendation to infer the membership of the target user's data. Finally, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed metric-based MIA on hybrid-based recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u7279\u6027\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u63a8\u8350\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u653b\u51fb\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7279\u6027\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u7528\u6237\u83b7\u53d6\u53c2\u8003\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u63a8\u8350\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6210\u5458\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7279\u6027\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Zero-Touch Networks (ZTNs) represent a transformative paradigm toward fully automated and intelligent network management, providing the scalability and adaptability required for the complexity of sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, the distributed architecture, high openness, and deep heterogeneity of 6G networks expand the attack surface and pose unprecedented security challenges. To address this, security automation aims to enable intelligent security management across dynamic and complex environments, serving as a key capability for securing 6G ZTNs. Despite its promise, implementing security automation in 6G ZTNs presents two primary challenges: 1) automating the lifecycle from security strategy generation to validation and update under real-world, parallel, and adversarial conditions, and 2) adapting security strategies to evolving threats and dynamic environments. This motivates us to propose SecLoop and SA-GRPO. SecLoop constitutes the first fully automated framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) across the entire lifecycle of security strategy generation, orchestration, response, and feedback, enabling intelligent and adaptive defenses in dynamic network environments, thus tackling the first challenge. Furthermore, we propose SA-GRPO, a novel security-aware group relative policy optimization algorithm that iteratively refines security strategies by contrasting group feedback collected from parallel SecLoop executions, thereby addressing the second challenge. Extensive real-world experiments on five benchmarks, including 11 MITRE ATT&CK processes and over 20 types of attacks, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SecLoop and SA-GRPO. We will release our platform to the community, facilitating the advancement of security automation towards next generation communications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SecLoop\u548cSA-GRPO\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b36G\u96f6\u63a5\u89e6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u96f6\u63a5\u89e6\u7f51\u7edc\u5177\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u662f\u5b9e\u73b06G ZTN\u667a\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SecLoop\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9632\u5fa1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SA-GRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u7fa4\u4f53\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4ece\u5e76\u884cSecLoop\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec11\u4e2aMITRE ATT&CK\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u8d85\u8fc720\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SecLoop\u548cSA-GRPO\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u5411\u793e\u533a\u53d1\u5e03\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "SecLoop\u548cSA-GRPO\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e866G\u96f6\u63a5\u89e6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Their unique characteristics, however, introduce challenges that undermine established paradigms of reproducibility, rigor, and evaluation. Prior work has identified common pitfalls in traditional machine learning research, but these studies predate the advent of LLMs. In this paper, we identify \\emph{nine} common pitfalls that have become (more) relevant with the emergence of LLMs and that can compromise the validity of research involving them. These pitfalls span the entire computation process, from data collection, pre-training, and fine-tuning to prompting and evaluation.\n  We assess the prevalence of these pitfalls across all 72 peer-reviewed papers published at leading Security and Software Engineering venues between 2023 and 2024. We find that every paper contains at least one pitfall, and each pitfall appears in multiple papers.

To achieve this goal, a two-stage strategy combining LLM-guided program synthesis with evolutionary search is applied in the proposed method. In the first stage, a certain number of cost functions in the form of computer program are synthesized from LLM responses to structured prompts. These cost functions are then evaluated with pretrained steganalysis models so that candidate cost functions suited to steganography can be collected. In the second stage, by retraining a steganalysis model for each candidate cost function, the optimal cost function(s) can be determined according to the detection accuracy. This two-stage strategy is performed by an iterative fashion so that the best cost function can be collected at the last iteration. Experiments show that the proposed method enables LLMs to design new cost functions of steganography that significantly outperform existing works in terms of resisting steganalysis tools, which verifies the superiority of the proposed method.

Existing BFA discovery methods lack generalizability and struggle to scale, often failing to analyze the vast parameter space and complex interdependencies of modern foundation models in a reasonable time. This paper proposes FlipLLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture-agnostic framework that formulates BFA discovery as a sequential decision-making problem. FlipLLM combines sensitivity-guided layer pruning with Q-learning to efficiently identify minimal, high-impact bit sets that can induce catastrophic failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of FlipLLM by applying it to a diverse set of models, including prominent text-only LLMs (GPT-2 Large, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and DeepSeek-V2 7B), VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6, and datasets, such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, VQAv2, and TextVQA. Our results show that FlipLLM can identify critical bits that are vulnerable to BFAs up to 2.5x faster than SOTA methods. We demonstrate that flipping the FlipLLM-identified bits plummets the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1 8B from 69.9% to ~0.2%, and for LLaVA's VQA score from 78% to almost 0%, by flipping as few as 5 and 7 bits, respectively. Further analysis reveals that applying standard hardware protection mechanisms, such as ECC SECDED, to the FlipLLM-identified bit locations completely mitigates the BFA impact, demonstrating the practical value of our framework in guiding hardware-level defenses. FlipLLM offers the first scalable and adaptive methodology for exploring the BFA vulnerability of both language and multimodal foundation models, paving the way for comprehensive hardware-security evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlipLLM\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb2.5\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6307\u5bfc\u786c\u4ef6\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e9e\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6613\u53d7\u786c\u4ef6\u5a01\u80c1\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlipLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb\u53d1\u73b0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u548cQ\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u5c0f\u4f46\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4f4d\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "result": "FlipLLM\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb2.5\u500d\uff0c\u4ec5\u7ffb\u8f6c5\u4f4d\u5c31\u80fd\u5c06LLaMA 3.1 8B\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece69.9%\u964d\u81f30.2%\uff0c\u7ffb\u8f6c7\u4f4d\u5c06LLaVA\u7684VQA\u5f97\u5206\u4ece78%\u964d\u81f3\u8fd10%\u3002\u5e94\u7528ECC SECDED\u7b49\u786c\u4ef6\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5b8c\u5168\u7f13\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "FlipLLM\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5bfc\u786c\u4ef6\u9632\u62a4\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In response, the research community has proposed defenses based on randomized and (de)randomized smoothing. However, these techniques remain susceptible to attacks that insert large adversarial payloads. To address these limitations, we propose a novel defense mechanism designed to harden end-to-end malware detectors by leveraging masking at the byte level. This mechanism operates by generating multiple masked versions of the input file, independently classifying each version, and then applying a threshold-based voting mechanism to produce the final classification. Key to this defense is a deterministic masking strategy that systematically strides a mask across the entire input file. Unlike randomized smoothing defenses, which randomly mask or delete bytes, this structured approach ensures coverage of the file over successive versions. In the best-case scenario, this strategy fully occludes the adversarial payload, effectively neutralizing its influence on the model's decision. In the worst-case scenario, it partially occludes the adversarial payload, reducing its impact on the model's predictions. By occluding the adversarial payload in one or more masked versions, this defense ensures that some input versions remain representative of the file's original intent, allowing the voting mechanism to suppress the influence of the adversarial payload. Results achieved on the EMBER and BODMAS datasets demonstrate the suitability of our defense, outperforming randomized and (de)randomized smoothing defenses against adversarial examples generated with a wide range of functionality-preserving manipulations while maintaining high accuracy on clean examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u63a9\u7801\u7248\u672c\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u3001\u72ec\u7acb\u5206\u7c7b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u6297\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5316\u548c\u53bb\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u63d2\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6ed1\u52a8\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u63a9\u7801\u7248\u672c\u3002\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u72ec\u7acb\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u7ec8\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728EMBER\u548cBODMAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5316\u548c\u53bb\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5e73\u6ed1\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u5404\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u64cd\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

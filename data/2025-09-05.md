### [1] [Reactive Bottom-Up Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03711)
*Siddharth Muralee,Sourag Cherupattamoolayil,James C. Davis,Antonio Bianchi,Aravind Machiry*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出Reactive Bottom-Up Testing新范式，通过三阶段自底向上测试方法（识别漏洞函数、模糊测试提取约束、验证消除误报），在基准测试中成功检测28个已知漏洞，并在真实应用中发现了6个新漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态测试技术采用自上而下方法，难以深入调用图底层的函数。现有的自底向上方法面临误报和生成符合程序上下文的有效输入等挑战。

Method: 三阶段自底向上测试方案：1)识别可能易受攻击的函数并生成类型和上下文感知的测试框架；2)通过模糊测试发现崩溃并使用符号执行提取输入约束；3)结合约束验证崩溃以消除误报。开发了自动化原型Griller。

Result: 在包含5个开源项目48个已知漏洞的基准测试中，成功检测到28个已知漏洞。在Pacman等真实世界应用中发现了6个先前未知的漏洞。

Conclusion: Reactive Bottom-Up Testing能显著增强复杂系统中漏洞的检测能力，为更强大的安全实践铺平道路。

Abstract: Modern computing systems remain rife with software vulnerabilities. Engineers
apply many means to detect them, of which dynamic testing is one of the most
common and effective. However, most dynamic testing techniques follow a
top-down paradigm, and struggle to reach and exercise functions deep within the
call graph. While recent works have proposed Bottom-Up approaches to address
these limitations, they face challenges with false positives and generating
valid inputs that adhere to the context of the entire program.
  In this work, we introduce a new paradigm that we call Reactive Bottom-Up
Testing. Our insight is that function-level testing is necessary but not
sufficient for the validation of vulnerabilities in functions. What we need is
a systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also
validates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that
detected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a
three-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions
and generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and
extract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by
combining constraints to remove false positives. We implemented an automated
prototype, which we call Griller. We evaluated Griller in a controlled setting
using a benchmark of 48 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects,
where we successfully detected 28 known vulnerabilities. Additionally, we
evaluated Griller on several real-world applications such as Pacman, and it
discovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities. Our findings suggest that
Reactive Bottom-Up Testing can significantly enhance the detection of
vulnerabilities in complex systems, paving the way for more robust security
practices.

*Hamid Barati*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 采用量子遗传算法与自监督学习相结合的混合弊入检测系统，为资源受限的IoT环境提供轻量级但高效的安全保护方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统弊入检测系统在IoT环境中存在计算成本高、依赖标签数据集等问题，需要一种轻量级且高效的解决方案

Method: 设计了一种混合弊入检测系统，结合量子遗传算法(QGA)用于特征选择和模型参数优化，以及自监督学习(SSL)从无标签数据中学习突出表征

Result: 在标准IoT弊入数据集上评估，在检测准确率、假正率和计算效率方面都显示出超过传统进化算法和深度学习模型的优异性能

Conclusion: 量子受灵感优化与自监督学习的结合为IoT和WSN环境设计下一代弊入检测解决方案展示了强大潜力

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSNs) has significantly increased the attack surface of such systems,
making them vulnerable to a wide range of cyber threats. Traditional Intrusion
Detection Systems (IDS) often fail to meet the stringent requirements of
resource-constrained IoT environments due to their high computational cost and
reliance on large labeled datasets. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a novel hybrid Intrusion Detection System that integrates a Quantum
Genetic Algorithm (QGA) with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). The QGA leverages
quantum-inspired evolutionary operators to optimize feature selection and
fine-tune model parameters, ensuring lightweight yet efficient detection in
resource-limited networks. Meanwhile, SSL enables the system to learn robust
representations from unlabeled data, thereby reducing dependency on manually
labeled training sets. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark IoT
intrusion datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of detection
accuracy, false positive rate, and computational efficiency compared to
conventional evolutionary and deep learning-based IDS models. The results
highlight the potential of combining quantum-inspired optimization with
self-supervised paradigms to design next-generation intrusion detection
solutions for IoT and WSN environments.

### [3] [Peekaboo, I See Your Queries: Passive Attacks Against DSSE Via Intermittent Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03806)
*Hao Nie,Wei Wang,Peng Xu,Wei Chen,Laurence T. Yang,Mauro Conti,Kaitai Liang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Peekaboo是一个针对动态可搜索对称加密(DSSE)的新型通用攻击框架，能够在间歇性观察的实用威胁模型下，通过推断搜索模式并结合辅助知识和其他泄漏信息，显著提升攻击准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DSSE被动攻击需要持续监控泄漏模式，而实际场景中攻击者往往只能进行间歇性观察。本文旨在解决这种更实用的威胁模型下的攻击问题。

Method: 提出Peekaboo通用攻击框架，核心设计是通过推断搜索模式，并结合辅助知识和其他泄漏信息。在Sap和Jigsaw等SOTA攻击基础上实例化，得到Sap+和Jigsaw+变体。

Result: 实验表明：搜索模式恢复的调整兰德指数>0.9；查询准确率达到90%（相比FMA的30%）；准确率随观察轮次和查询数量增加而提升；对SOTA防御措施具有抵抗力（文件大小填充>40%准确率，混淆>80%准确率）。

Conclusion: Peekaboo框架在间歇性观察的实用威胁模型下表现出色，显著提升了DSSE攻击的准确性和鲁棒性，对现有防御措施具有很好的抵抗能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) allows secure searches over a
dynamic encrypted database but suffers from inherent information leakage.
Existing passive attacks against DSSE rely on persistent leakage monitoring to
infer leakage patterns, whereas this work targets intermittent observation - a
more practical threat model. We propose Peekaboo - a new universal attack
framework - and the core design relies on inferring the search pattern and
further combining it with auxiliary knowledge and other leakage. We instantiate
Peekaboo over the SOTA attacks, Sap (USENIX' 21) and Jigsaw (USENIX' 24), to
derive their "+" variants (Sap+ and Jigsaw+). Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our design achieves >0.9 adjusted rand index for search pattern recovery
and 90% query accuracy vs. FMA's 30% (CCS' 23). Peekaboo's accuracy scales with
observation rounds and the number of observed queries but also it resists SOTA
countermeasures, with >40% accuracy against file size padding and >80% against
obfuscation.

### [4] [BIDO: A Unified Approach to Address Obfuscation and Concept Drift Challenges in Image-based Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03807)
*Junhui Li,Chengbin Feng,Zhiwei Yang,Qi Mo,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BIDO是一种基于图像的混合恶意软件检测器，通过局部特征选择、跨模态依赖建模和可学习度量，同时增强对混淆和概念漂移的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的Android恶意软件检测方法在面对混淆和概念漂移时性能显著下降，且通常将这两个挑战视为独立问题处理，忽略了它们共同的统计根源——分布外问题。

Method: 1) 局部特征选择模块识别恶意软件图像中的信息子区域；2) 在外积空间中建模跨模态依赖关系提取稳定共现模式；3) 设计可学习度量使相同标签样本靠近、不同标签样本远离。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，BIDO显著优于现有基线方法，对概念漂移和混淆都具有更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BIDO通过同时处理混淆和概念漂移的共同统计根源，有效提升了基于图像的恶意软件检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: To identify malicious Android applications, various malware detection
techniques have been proposed. Among them, image-based approaches are
considered potential alternatives due to their efficiency and scalability.
Recent studies have reported that these approaches suffer significant
performance declines when confronted with obfuscation or concept drift.
However, existing solutions often treat these two challenges as different
problems, offering independent solutions. These techniques overlook the fact
that both challenges share a common statistical root, out-of-distribution, and
research from this perspective remains limited. In response, we propose BIDO, a
hybrid image-based malware detector designed to enhance robustness against both
obfuscation and concept drift simultaneously. Specifically, to improve the
discriminative power of image features, we introduce a local feature selection
module that identifies informative subregions within malware images. Second, to
enhance feature robustness, we model pairwise cross-modal dependencies in an
outer product space, enabling the extraction of stable co-occurrence patterns.
Third, to ensure feature compactness, we design a learnable metric that pulls
samples with identical labels closer while pushing apart those with different
labels, regardless of obfuscation or concept drift. Extensive experiments on
the real-world datasets demonstrate that BIDO significantly outperforms
existing baselines, achieving higher robustness against both concept drift and
obfuscation. The source code is available at:

### [5] [Rethinking Tamper-Evident Logging: A High-Performance, Co-Designed Auditing System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03821)
*Rui Zhao,Muhammad Shoaib,Viet Tung Hoang,Wajih Ul Hassan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Nitro是一个高性能的防篡改审计日志系统，使用eBPF技术避免内核重编译，提供细粒度篡改检测，性能比现有系统提升10-25倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防篡改日志系统在高负载下开销大、数据丢失严重，只能提供粗粒度检测，且需要重新编译内核代码

Method: 使用eBPF技术避免内核重编译，密码学构造与日志前后处理协同设计，利用系统级优化，提供Nitro-R变体进行内核日志缩减

Result: 在高压力条件下性能提升10-25倍，实际场景中提升2-10倍，保持接近零数据丢失

Conclusion: Nitro系统成功解决了现有防篡改日志系统的性能和数据丢失问题，通过eBPF技术和系统级优化实现了高性能的细粒度篡改检测

Abstract: Existing tamper-evident logging systems suffer from high overhead and severe
data loss in high-load settings, yet only provide coarse-grained tamper
detection. Moreover, installing such systems requires recompiling kernel code.
To address these challenges, we present Nitro, a high-performance,
tamper-evident audit logging system that supports fine-grained detection of log
tampering. Even better, our system avoids kernel recompilation by using the
eBPF technology. To formally justify the security of Nitro, we provide a new
definitional framework for logging systems, and give a practical cryptographic
construction meeting this new goal. Unlike prior work that focus only on the
cryptographic processing, we codesign the cryptographic part with the pre- and
post-processing of the logs to exploit all system-level optimizations. Our
evaluations demonstrate Nitro's superior performance, achieving 10X-25X
improvements in high-stress conditions and 2X-10X in real-world scenarios while
maintaining near-zero data loss. We also provide an advanced variant, Nitro-R
that introduces in-kernel log reduction techniques to reduce runtime overhead
even further.

*Yifan Jia,Ye Tian,Liguo Zhang,Yanbin Wang,Jianguo Sun,Liangliang Song*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: KGBERT4Eth是一个融合交易语义提取和知识图谱的预训练编码器，通过联合优化两个组件来生成特征完整的嵌入表示，在以太坊恶意活动检测任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以太坊生态快速扩张和交易匿名性导致恶意活动激增，现有检测方法分为专家定义特征、图嵌入和序列交易模式三种技术路线，但缺乏跨范式集成机制，迫使实践者必须在牺牲序列上下文感知、结构化资金流模式或人工策划特征洞察之间做出选择。

Method: 提出KGBERT4Eth预训练编码器，包含两个关键组件：(1)交易语义提取器，训练增强的交易语言模型(TLM)从概念化交易记录中学习上下文语义表示；(2)交易知识图谱(TKG)，将专家策划的领域知识融入图节点嵌入以捕获资金流模式和人工特征洞察。通过联合优化预训练目标融合这些互补特征，并设计偏置掩码预测任务和链接预测任务来关注异常交易和潜在关系。

Result: 在钓鱼账户检测和去匿名化任务中显著优于最先进基线方法，在三个钓鱼检测基准上实现8-16%的绝对F1分数提升，在四个去匿名化数据集上实现6-26%的提升。

Conclusion: KGBERT4Eth成功解决了现有检测方法范式割裂的问题，通过融合语义理解和知识图谱实现了特征完整的嵌入表示，为以太坊恶意活动检测提供了有效的跨范式集成解决方案。

Abstract: Ethereum's rapid ecosystem expansion and transaction anonymity have triggered
a surge in malicious activity. Detection mechanisms currently bifurcate into
three technical strands: expert-defined features, graph embeddings, and
sequential transaction patterns, collectively spanning the complete feature
sets of Ethereum's native data layer. Yet the absence of cross-paradigm
integration mechanisms forces practitioners to choose between sacrificing
sequential context awareness, structured fund-flow patterns, or human-curated
feature insights in their solutions. To bridge this gap, we propose KGBERT4Eth,
a feature-complete pre-training encoder that synergistically combines two key
components: (1) a Transaction Semantic Extractor, where we train an enhanced
Transaction Language Model (TLM) to learn contextual semantic representations
from conceptualized transaction records, and (2) a Transaction Knowledge Graph
(TKG) that incorporates expert-curated domain knowledge into graph node
embeddings to capture fund flow patterns and human-curated feature insights. We
jointly optimize pre-training objectives for both components to fuse these
complementary features, generating feature-complete embeddings. To emphasize
rare anomalous transactions, we design a biased masking prediction task for TLM
to focus on statistical outliers, while the Transaction TKG employs link
prediction to learn latent transaction relationships and aggregate knowledge.
Furthermore, we propose a mask-invariant attention coordination module to
ensure stable dynamic information exchange between TLM and TKG during
pre-training. KGBERT4Eth significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both phishing account detection and de-anonymization tasks, achieving
absolute F1-score improvements of 8-16% on three phishing detection benchmarks
and 6-26% on four de-anonymization datasets.

### [7] [ShieldMMU: Detecting and Defending against Controlled-Channel Attacks in Shielding Memory System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03879)
*Gang Liu,Ningjie Li,Cen Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ShieldMMU是一个针对Intel SGX侧信道攻击的防御方案，通过DD-Tree保护页表项完整性，检测和恢复被攻击的PTE，平衡了兼容性、性能和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intel SGX和虚拟机监控程序虽然能隔离非特权程序，但侧信道攻击仍然威胁SGX安全，恶意操作系统可以通过操纵PTE存在位来窃取内存访问痕迹。现有防御方案要么专注于检测，要么依赖不切实际的解决方案。

Method: 提出ShieldMMU方案，利用受Merkle Tree启发的防御树（DD-Tree）来保护PTE完整性，能够检测、定位和恢复被攻击的PTE。系统识别MMU页表查找事件和侧信道攻击，及时恢复PTE参数以防止页面错误陷阱。

Result: 实验证实ShieldMMU具有增强的安全性和可接受的延迟性能。

Conclusion: ShieldMMU提供了一个全面的解决方案，有效缓解受控信道攻击，在兼容性、性能和可用性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Intel SGX and hypervisors isolate non-privileged programs from other
software, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. However, side-channel attacks
continue to threaten Intel SGX's security, enabling malicious OS to manipulate
PTE present bits, induce page faults, and steal memory access traces. Despite
extensive research, existing defenses focus on detection or rely on impractical
solutions. This paper presents ShieldMMU, a comprehensive solution for
mitigating controlled channel attacks, balancing compatibility, performance,
and usability. Leveraging a Merkle Tree-inspired Defense Tree (DD-Tree),
ShieldMMU protects PTE integrity by detecting, locating, and restoring attacked
PTEs. It identifies MMU page table lookup events and side-channel attacks,
promptly restoring PTE parameters to prevent page fault traps and ensure secure
non-privileged application operation within SGX. Our experiments confirm
ShieldMMU's enhanced security and acceptable latency performance.

*Yifan Jia,Yanbin Wang,Jianguo Sun,Ye Tian,Peng Qian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LMAE4Eth是一个多视图学习框架，通过融合交易语义、掩码图嵌入和专家知识，显著提升了以太坊欺诈账户检测性能，在三个数据集上超越21个基线方法，其中两个数据集F1分数提升超过10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前以太坊欺诈检测方法存在三个主要问题：1）依赖上下文无关的数值交易序列，无法捕捉交易语义；2）交易记录同质化严重，难以学习区分性账户嵌入；3）现有自监督图学习方法主要关注图重构，在节点级任务上表现不佳且扩展性差。

Method: 提出LMAE4Eth框架，包含三个核心组件：1）TxCLM交易-令牌对比语言模型，将数值交易记录转换为连贯的语言表示；2）MAGAE掩码账户图自编码器，使用生成式自监督学习重构账户节点特征；3）跨注意力融合网络，统一TxCLM和MAGAE的嵌入表示。采用层邻居采样技术提升扩展性。

Result: 在三个数据集上评估，与21个基线方法对比，该方法在两个数据集上的F1分数比最佳基线提升超过10%，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LMAE4Eth通过融合多视图学习和自监督技术，成功解决了以太坊欺诈检测中的语义捕捉、表征学习和扩展性挑战，为区块链安全提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods rely on context-independent,
numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account
transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction
records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings.
Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node
representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal
performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these
methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we
propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction
semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a
transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms
context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive
linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences
between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training
objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective,
learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked
account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning,
which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on
reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale
training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which
reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising
training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the
embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our
method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on
two of the datasets.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: NeuroBreak是一个自上而下的越狱分析系统，通过神经元级安全机制分析和漏洞缓解来增强大语言模型对越狱攻击的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着越狱攻击技术的不断发展，大语言模型的安全防御面临越来越大的压力。由于LLMs参数数量庞大、结构复杂，从内部视角分析安全弱点具有挑战性。

Method: 设计了一个包含层级表示探测分析的系统，提供对模型生成步骤中决策过程的新视角，支持从语义和功能角度分析关键神经元。

Result: 通过定量评估和案例研究验证了系统的有效性，为开发下一代防御策略提供了机制性见解。

Conclusion: NeuroBreak系统能够深入分析神经元级安全机制，帮助理解和缓解大语言模型的安全漏洞，为对抗不断演变的越狱攻击提供重要工具。

Abstract: In deployment and application, large language models (LLMs) typically undergo
safety alignment to prevent illegal and unethical outputs. However, the
continuous advancement of jailbreak attack techniques, designed to bypass
safety mechanisms with adversarial prompts, has placed increasing pressure on
the security defenses of LLMs. Strengthening resistance to jailbreak attacks
requires an in-depth understanding of the security mechanisms and
vulnerabilities of LLMs. However, the vast number of parameters and complex
structure of LLMs make analyzing security weaknesses from an internal
perspective a challenging task. This paper presents NeuroBreak, a top-down
jailbreak analysis system designed to analyze neuron-level safety mechanisms
and mitigate vulnerabilities. We carefully design system requirements through
collaboration with three experts in the field of AI security. The system
provides a comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods. By
incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a
novel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its
generation steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical
neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper
exploration of security mechanisms. We conduct quantitative evaluations and
case studies to verify the effectiveness of our system, offering mechanistic
insights for developing next-generation defense strategies against evolving
jailbreak attacks.

### [10] [Systematic Timing Leakage Analysis of NIST PQDSS Candidates: Tooling and Lessons Learned](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04010)
*Olivier Adjonyo,Sebastien Bardin,Emanuele Bellini,Gilbert Ndollane Dione,Mahmudul Faisal Al Ameen,Robert Merget,Frederic Recoules,Yanis Sellami*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文为NIST PQDSS标准化过程开发了一个自动化工具链，用于验证加密算法的常数时间性质，发现并修复了26个安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为PQDSS标准需要加密原语遵循常数时间原则，以避免时间和缓存侦测漏洞，而手动分析编译后的二进制代码极其困难，需要自动化工具支持。

Method: 开发了一个自动化工具链，整合了TIMECOP、Binsec/Rel2用于二进制层面的常数时间验证，以及ddudect和RTLF用于执行时间行为的统计分析检测侦测漏洞。

Result: 对NIST PQDSS第一轮和第二轮实现进行了评估，向开发者报告了26个问题，其中5个已经修复，并分析了不同工具的优缺点。

Conclusion: 该自动化工具链有效地支持了PQDSS标准的常数时间性验证，显示了自动化分析在加密安全评估中的重要性。

Abstract: The PQDSS standardization process requires cryptographic primitives to be
free from vulnerabilities, including timing and cache side-channels. Resistance
to timing leakage is therefore an essential property, and achieving this
typically relies on software implementations that follow constant-time
principles. Moreover, ensuring that all implementations are constant-time is
crucial for fair performance comparisons, as secure implementations often incur
additional overhead. Such analysis also helps identify scheme proposals that
are inherently difficult to implement in constant time. Because constant-time
properties can be broken during compilation, it is often necessary to analyze
the compiled binary directly. Since manual binary analysis is extremely
challenging, automated analysis becomes highly important. Although several
tools exist to assist with such analysis, they often have usability limitations
and are difficult to set up correctly. To support the developers besides the
NIST committee in verifying candidates, we developed a toolchain that automates
configuration, execution, and result analysis for several widely used
constant-time analysis tools. We selected TIMECOP and Binsec/Rel2 to verify
constant-time policy compliance at the binary level, and dudect and RTLF to
detect side-channel vulnerabilities through statistical analysis of execution
time behavior. We demonstrate its effectiveness and practicability by
evaluating the NIST PQDSS round 1 and round 2 implementations. We reported 26
issues in total to the respective developers, and 5 of them have already been
fixed. We also discuss our different findings, as well as the benefits of
shortcomings of the different tools.

*Paresh Baidya,Rourab Paul,Vikas Srivastava,Sumit Kumar Debnath*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了三种高效轻量效敏错误检测方法，特别是新算法RESWO，用于保护Kyber等后醻子加密算法的Barrett约减模块，以防范敏感信息泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 敏感信息泄漏会威胁后醻子加密算法的确定性，Kyber等算法在硬件实现层面可能存在歧道攻击风险，需要有效的敏错检测方法来保护硬件加速器。

Method: 提出了三种重计算基于的敏错检测方法：RESWO（交换操作数重计算）、RENO（取反操作数重计算）和RESO（位移操作数重计算），应用于Kyber算法的Cooley-Tukey蝶形单元中的Barrett约减模块。

Result: RESWO方法在占用细胞数量上与RENO和RESO相似，但延迟更小。三种方法的敏错检测效率都接近100%。

Conclusion: 这些方法能够有效防范敏感信息通过敏错泄漏，特别是RESWO方法在性能方面显示出优势，适用于后醻子加密算法的硬件安全保护。

Abstract: A fault can occur naturally or intentionally. However, intentionally
injecting faults into hardware accelerators of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC)
algorithms may leak sensitive information. This intentional fault injection in
side-channel attacks compromises the reliability of PQC implementations. The
recently NIST-standardized key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), Kyber may also
leak information at the hardware implementation level. This work proposes three
efficient and lightweight recomputation-based fault detection methods for
Barrett Reduction in the Cooley-Tukey Butterfly Unit (CT-BU) of Kyber on a
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The CT-BU and Barrett Reduction are
fundamental components in structured lattice-based PQC algorithms, including
Kyber, NTRU, Falcon, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, etc. This paper introduces a new
algorithm, Recomputation with Swapped Operand (RESWO), for fault detection.
While Recomputation with Negated Operand (RENO) and Recomputation with Shifted
Operand (RESO) are existing methods used in other PQC hardware algorithms. To
the best of our knowledge, RENO and RESO have never been used in Barrett
Reduction before. The proposed RESWO method consumes a similar number of slices
compared to RENO and RESO. However, RESWO shows lesser delay compared to both
RENO and RESO. The fault detection efficiency of RESWO, RENO, and RESO is
nearly 100%.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了ICSLure模块化蜜网框架，通过整合物理PLC和虚拟化网络组件来模拟真实工业控制系统环境，提高威胁数据收集质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业控制系统安全至关重要，但传统ICS蜜罐缺乏真实性，无法有效吸引复杂攻击者进行分析

Method: 设计模块化蜜网框架，集成物理PLC与实时数据源交互，支持Modbus和Profinet RTU等工业协议，包含虚拟化网络组件和全面监控能力

Result: 能够实现真实工业工厂的高保真模拟，显著提升威胁数据收集质量，支持对ICS特定攻击策略的深入分析

Conclusion: ICSLure框架通过高交互环境有效增强了工业控制系统威胁检测和分析能力，有助于开发更有效的检测和缓解技术

Abstract: The security of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) is critical to ensuring the
safety of industrial processes and personnel. The rapid adoption of Industrial
Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies has expanded system functionality but
also increased the attack surface, exposing ICSs to a growing range of cyber
threats. Honeypots provide a means to detect and analyze such threats by
emulating target systems and capturing attacker behavior. However, traditional
ICS honeypots, often limited to software-based simulations of a single
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), lack the realism required to engage
sophisticated adversaries. In this work, we introduce a modular honeynet
framework named ICSLure. The framework has been designed to emulate realistic
ICS environments. Our approach integrates physical PLCs interacting with live
data sources via industrial protocols such as Modbus and Profinet RTU, along
with virtualized network components including routers, switches, and Remote
Terminal Units (RTUs). The system incorporates comprehensive monitoring
capabilities to collect detailed logs of attacker interactions. We demonstrate
that our framework enables coherent and high-fidelity emulation of real-world
industrial plants. This high-interaction environment significantly enhances the
quality of threat data collected and supports advanced analysis of ICS-specific
attack strategies, contributing to more effective detection and mitigation
techniques.

security, supporting vulnerability tracking, malware detection, and supply
chain auditing. Despite many proposed tools, their real-world effectiveness
remains unclear.We present the first large-scale empirical study of ten
state-of-the-art TPL detection techniques across over 6,000 apps, enabled by a
new ground truth dataset with precise version-level annotations for both remote
and local dependencies.Our evaluation exposes tool fragility to R8-era
transformations, weak version discrimination, inaccurate correspondence of
candidate libraries, difficulty in generalizing similarity thresholds, and
prohibitive runtime/memory overheads at scale.Beyond tool assessment, we
further analyze how TPLs shape downstream tasks, including vulnerability
analysis, malware detection, secret leakage assessment, and LLM-based
evaluation. From this perspective, our study provides concrete insights into
how TPL characteristics affect these tasks and informs future improvements in
security analysis.

### [14] [ECCFROG522PP: An Enhanced 522-bit Weierstrass Elliptic Curve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04097)
*Víctor Duarte Melo,William J. Buchanan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ECCFROG522PP是一个522位素数域椭圆曲线，提供约260位经典安全性，采用完全透明和可重现的设计，所有参数通过BLAKE3从固定公共种子确定性派生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前256位安全级别的密钥交换和数字签名系统主要依赖NIST P-256等曲线，但缺乏透明性和可重现性。需要提供同等安全级别但设计更可信的曲线。

Method: 使用BLAKE3哈希函数从固定公共种子确定性派生所有曲线参数，确保零隐藏选择。曲线具有素数阶、验证的扭曲、安全嵌入度等特性。

Result: 成功设计出ECCFROG522PP曲线，具有与NIST P-521相当的安全级别，但提供了完全可重现和验证的设计。通过了抗MOV检查和CM判别式检查。

Conclusion: ECCFROG522PP为260位安全级别提供了一个透明、可验证的实用椭圆曲线替代方案，重点在于最大化信任和可审计性而非原始性能。

Abstract: Whilst many key exchange and digital signature systems still rely on NIST
P-256 (secp256r1) and secp256k1, offering around 128-bit security, there is an
increasing demand for transparent and reproducible curves at the 256-bit
security level. Standard higher-security options include NIST P-521, Curve448,
and Brainpool-P512. This paper presents ECCFROG522PP ("Presunto Powered"), a
522-bit prime-field elliptic curve that delivers security in the same classical
approx 260-bit ballpark as NIST P-521, but with a fundamentally different
design philosophy. All of the curve parameters are deterministically derived
from a fixed public seed via BLAKE3, with zero hidden choices. The curve has
prime order (cofactor = 1), a verified twist with a proven approx 505-bit prime
factor, safe embedding degree (greater than or equal to 14), and passes
anti-MOV checks up to k less than or equal to 200 and CM discriminant sanity up
to 100k. Unlike prior opaque or ad-hoc constructions, ECCFROG522PP is fully
reproducible: anyone can regenerate and verify it byte-for-byte using the
published scripts. The intent is not to outperform NIST P-521 in raw speed, but
to maximise trust, verifiability, and long-term auditability in a practical
curve of equivalent security level

TL;DR: KubeGuard是一个基于运行时日志的Kubernetes安全推荐框架，使用大语言模型分析配置清单和运行时日志，通过资源创建和资源优化两个任务来减少过度权限配置，提高集群安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kubernetes的广泛采用带来了严重的安全挑战，如错误配置和过度权限设置，可能导致未授权访问和权限提升。现有解决方案主要关注检测错误配置，而缺乏针对过度权限配置的缓解措施。

Method: 提出KubeGuard框架，利用大语言模型分析Kubernetes清单和运行时日志，采用模块化提示链工作流，执行资源创建（为新资源创建最小权限配置）和资源优化（优化现有清单减少攻击面）两个互补任务。

Result: 评估显示KubeGuard能有效生成和优化Roles、NetworkPolicies和Deployments的Kubernetes清单，在使用专有和开源大语言模型时都表现出高精度、召回率和F1分数。

Conclusion: KubeGuard是一个实用的框架，能够将运行时可观测性转化为可操作的最小权限配置指导，帮助开发者和运维人员增强Kubernetes集群安全性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native
applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as
misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to
address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation,
and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions
focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or
anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime
log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly
permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments
through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It
leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs
reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.
This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for
new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.
KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,
developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our
evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s
manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both
proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores
affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime
observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.

Conclusion: 该创新流水线通过提高效果和可扩展性，扩展了现有模型反向工程DT&E能力，实现了隐私损失分析的自动化。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have the potential to transform military
battlefields, presenting a large external pressure to rapidly incorporate them
into operational settings. However, it is well-established that these ML models
are vulnerable to a number of adversarial attacks throughout the model
deployment pipeline that threaten to negate battlefield advantage. One broad
category is privacy attacks (such as model inversion) where an adversary can
reverse engineer information from the model, such as the sensitive data used in
its training. The ability to quantify the risk of model inversion attacks
(MIAs) is not well studied, and there is a lack of automated developmental test
and evaluation (DT&E) tools and metrics to quantify the effectiveness of
privacy loss of the MIA. The current DT&E process is difficult because ML model
inversions can be hard for a human to interpret, subjective when they are
interpretable, and difficult to quantify in terms of inversion quality.
Additionally, scaling the DT&E process is challenging due to many ML model
architectures and data modalities that need to be assessed. In this work, we
present a novel DT&E tool that quantifies the risk of data privacy loss from
MIAs and introduces four adversarial risk dimensions to quantify privacy loss.
Our DT&E pipeline combines inversion with vision language models (VLMs) to
improve effectiveness while enabling scalable analysis. We demonstrate
effectiveness using multiple MIA techniques and VLMs configured for zero-shot
classification and image captioning. We benchmark the pipeline using several
state-of-the-art MIAs in the computer vision domain with an image
classification task that is typical in military applications. In general, our
innovative pipeline extends the current model inversion DT&E capabilities by
improving the effectiveness and scalability of the privacy loss analysis in an
automated fashion.

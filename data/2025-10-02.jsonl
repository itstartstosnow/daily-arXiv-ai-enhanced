As a result, AI model\nstealing attacks pose a serious concern for AI model providers. In this work,\nwe present a novel attack targeting wireless devices equipped with AI hardware\naccelerators. The attack unfolds in two phases. In the first phase, the\nvictim's device is compromised with a hardware Trojan (HT) designed to covertly\nleak model weights through a hidden communication channel, without the victim\nrealizing it. In the second phase, the adversary uses a nearby wireless device\nto intercept the victim's transmission frames during normal operation and\nincrementally reconstruct the complete weight matrix. The proposed attack is\nagnostic to both the AI model architecture and the hardware accelerator used.\nWe validate our approach through a hardware-based demonstration involving four\ndiverse AI models of varying types and sizes. We detail the design of the HT\nand the covert channel, highlighting their stealthy nature. Additionally, we\nanalyze the impact of bit error rates on the reception and propose an error\nmitigation technique. The effectiveness of the attack is evaluated based on the\naccuracy of the reconstructed models with stolen weights and the time required\nto extract them. Finally, we explore potential defense mechanisms."}

One\nmain development over the past decade has been the decentralization of DP,\nincluding local DP and shuffle DP. Despite that decentralized DP heavily relies\non network communications for data collection,we found that: 1) no systematic\nstudy has surveyed the research opportunities at the intersection of networking\nand DP; 2) nor have there been significant efforts to develop DP mechanisms\nthat are explicitly tailored for network environments. In this paper, we seek\nto address this gap by initiating a new direction of network-aware DP. We\nidentified two focus areas where the network research can offer substantive\ncontributions to the design and deployment of DP, related to network security\nand topology. Through this work, we hope to encourage more research that\nadapt/optimize DP's deployment in various network environments."}

By 2024, attacks on the OT of critical national\ninfrastructure (CNI) had been linked to partisan hacktivist efforts in ongoing\ngeopolitical conflicts, demonstrating a shift from protest to something more\nresembling cyber warfare. This escalation raises critical questions about the\nclassification of these groups and the appropriate state response to their\ngrowing role in destabilizing international security.\n  This paper examines the strategic motivations behind escalatory hacktivism,\nhighlighting how states may tolerate, encourage, or leverage hacktivist groups\nas proxies in conflicts that blur the lines between activism, cybercrime, and\nstate-sponsored operations. We introduce a novel method for interpreting\nhacktivists based on the impact of their actions, alignment to state ideology,\nand host state involvement, offering a structured approach to understanding the\nphenomenon. Finally, we assess policy and security implications, particularly\nfor host and victim states, and propose strategies to address this evolving\nthreat.

However, extending this\nfunctionality to trusted applications (TA) -- executing within Trusted\nExecution Environments (TEEs) -- introduces unique challenges such as secure\nstate preservation, integrity verification, replay and rollback prevention, and\nmitigation of unauthorized cloning of TAs. We present TALOS, a lightweight\nframework for verifiable state management and trustworthy application\nmigration. While our implementation is prototyped and evaluated using Intel SGX\nwith the Gramine LibOS and RISC-V Keystone (evidencing the framework's\nportability across diverse TEEs), its design is agnostic to the underlying TEE\narchitecture. Such agility is a necessity in today's network service mesh\n(collaborative computing across the continuum) where application workloads must\nbe managed across domain boundaries in a harmonized fashion. TALOS is built\naround the principle of minimizing trust assumptions: TAs are treated as\nuntrusted until explicitly verified, and the migration process does not rely on\na trusted third party. To ensure both the integrity and secure launch of the\nmigrated application, TALOS integrates memory introspection and control-flow\ngraph extraction, enabling robust verification of state continuity and\nexecution flow. Thereby achieving strong security guarantees while maintaining\nefficiency, making it suitable for decentralized settings."}

In this work, we\ndemonstrate how an adversary can exploit the Y1 interface to launch selective\njamming attacks by passively monitoring downlink metrics. We propose and\nevaluate two Y1-aided jamming strategies: a clustering-based jammer leveraging\nDBSCAN for traffic profiling and a threshold-based jammer. These are compared\nagainst two baselines strategies -- always-on jammer and random jammer -- on an\nover-the-air LTE/5G O-RAN testbed. Experimental results show that in\nunconstrained jamming budget scenarios, the threshold-based jammer can closely\nreplicate the disruption caused by always-on jamming while reducing\ntransmission time by 27\\%. Under constrained jamming budgets, the\nclustering-based jammer proves most effective, causing up to an 18.1\\% bitrate\ndrop while remaining active only 25\\% of the time.

In this work, we introduce a verifiable federated learning\nprotocol that enables clients to verify the correctness of the aggregators\ncomputation without compromising the confidentiality of their updates.

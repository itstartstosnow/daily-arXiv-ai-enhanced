While\nseeking answers to know more on those security concerns, users are mostly left\nwith their own discretion while going through various sources, such as online\nblogs and technical manuals, which may render higher complexity to regular\nusers trying to extract the necessary information. This requirement does not go\nalong with the common mindsets of smart home users and hence threatens the\nsecurity of smart homes furthermore. In this paper, we aim to identify and\naddress the major user-level security concerns in smart homes. Specifically, we\ndevelop a novel dataset of Q&A from public forums, capturing practical security\nchallenges faced by smart home users. We extract major security concerns in\nsmart homes from our dataset by leveraging the Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA). We fine-tune relatively \"smaller\" transformer models, such as T5 and\nFlan-T5, on this dataset to build a QA system tailored for smart home security.\nUnlike larger models like GPT and Gemini, which are powerful but often resource\nhungry and require data sharing, smaller models are more feasible for\ndeployment in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments like smart\nhomes. The dataset is manually curated and supplemented with synthetic data to\nexplore its potential impact on model performance. This approach significantly\nimproves the system's ability to deliver accurate and relevant answers, helping\nusers address common security concerns with smart home IoT devices.

Although previous work tackled the issue of\nreversing physical-to-DRAM mapping, existing heuristic-based\nreverse-engineering approaches are partial, costly, and impractical for\ncomprehensive recovery. This paper establishes a rigorous theoretical\nfoundation and provides efficient practical algorithms for black-box, complete\nphysical-to-DRAM address-mapping recovery.\n  We first formulate the reverse-engineering problem within a linear algebraic\nmodel over the finite field GF(2). We characterize the timing fingerprints of\nrow-buffer conflicts, proving a relationship between a bank addressing matrix\nand an empirically constructed matrix of physical addresses. Based on this\ncharacterization, we develop an efficient, noise-robust, and fully\nplatform-agnostic algorithm to recover the full bank-mask basis in polynomial\ntime, a significant improvement over the exponential search from previous\nworks. We further generalize our model to complex row mappings, introducing new\nhardware-based hypotheses that enable the automatic recovery of a row basis\ninstead of previous human-guided contributions.\n  Evaluations across embedded and server-class architectures confirm our\nmethod's effectiveness, successfully reconstructing known mappings and\nuncovering previously unknown scrambling functions. Our method provides a 99%\nrecall and accuracy on all tested platforms. Most notably, Knock-Knock runs in\nunder a few minutes, even on systems with more than 500GB of DRAM, showcasing\nthe scalability of our method.

Experimental results show that CareerScape outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines by 5.8-85.0% relatively, highlighting the importance\nof structure-aware detection for machine-generated content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5CareerScape\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u865a\u5047\u804c\u4e1a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5f02\u8d28\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u56fe\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5408\u6210\u7b80\u5386\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7b80\u5386\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u865a\u5047\u804c\u4e1a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\u9700\u8981\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCareerScape\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7b80\u5386\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5f02\u8d28\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u56fe\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u56fe\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u90bb\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aCareerScape\u76f8\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53475.8-85.0%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u804c\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684CareerScape\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To effectively implant a backdoor, multiple\n\\textbf{triggers} are proposed for various attack requirements of Attack\nSuccess Rate (ASR) and stealthiness. Additionally, sample selection enhances\nclean-label backdoor attacks' ASR by meticulously selecting ``hard'' samples\ninstead of random samples to poison. Current methods 1) usually handle the\nsample selection and triggers in isolation, leading to severely limited\nimprovements on both ASR and stealthiness. Consequently, attacks exhibit\nunsatisfactory performance on evaluation metrics when converted to PCBAs via a\nmere stacking of methods. Therefore, we seek to explore the bidirectional\ncollaborative relations between the sample selection and triggers to address\nthe above dilemma. 2) Since the strong specificity within triggers, the simple\ncombination of sample selection and triggers fails to substantially enhance\nboth evaluation metrics, with generalization preserved among various attacks.\nTherefore, we seek to propose a set of components to significantly improve both\nstealthiness and ASR based on the commonalities of attacks. Specifically,\nComponent A ascertains two critical selection factors, and then makes them an\nappropriate combination based on the trigger scale to select more reasonable\n``hard'' samples for improving ASR. Component B is proposed to select samples\nwith similarities to relevant trigger implanted samples to promote\nstealthiness.

Attack trees are\nwidely used to systematically represent potential attack vectors, but\ngenerating comprehensive test cases from these trees remains a labor-intensive,\nerror-prone task that has seen limited automation in the context of testing\nvehicular systems. This paper introduces STAF (Security Test Automation\nFramework), a novel approach to automating security test case generation.\nLeveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a four-step self-corrective\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, STAF automates the generation\nof executable security test cases from attack trees, providing an end-to-end\nsolution that encompasses the entire attack surface. We particularly show the\nelements and processes needed to provide an LLM to actually produce sensible\nand executable automotive security test suites, along with the integration with\nan automated testing framework. We further compare our tailored approach with\ngeneral purpose (vanilla) LLMs and the performance of different LLMs (namely\nGPT-4.1 and DeepSeek) using our approach.

In this\npaper, we investigate the security threats to the SSC that arise from these\ninherent issues. We examine three categories of threats, including eleven\npotential SSC-related threats, related to external components in source code,\nand continuous integration configuration files.

To understand these security impacts and\nseverity, we design a tool, SSCGuard, to generate 439,138 prompts based on\nSSC-related questions collected online, and analyze the responses of four\npopular LLMs from GPT and Llama. Our results show that all identified\nSSC-related threats persistently exist.

They promise cost reduction, transparency, and flexible\nservice provision. However, these markets usually have large workload that must\nbe processed in a timely manner, leading to serious scalability problems.\nDespite the large amount of work on blockchain scalability, existing solutions\nare ineffective as they do not account for these markets' work models and\ntraffic patterns.\n  We introduce chainScale, a secure hybrid sidechain-sharding solution that\naims to boost throughput of decentralized resource markets and reduce their\nlatency and storage footprint. At its core, chainScale leverages dependent\nsidechains and functionality-oriented workload splitting to parallelize traffic\nprocessing by having each market module assigned to a sidechain. Different from\nsharding, chainScale does not incur any cross-sidechain transactions that tend\nto be costly. chainScale introduces several techniques, including hierarchical\nworkload sharing that further sub-divides overloaded modules, and weighted\nminer assignment that assigns miners with vested interest in the system to\ncritical modules' sidechains. Furthermore, chainScale employs sidechain syncing\nto maintain the mainchain as the single truth of system state, and pruning to\ndiscard stale records. Beside analyzing security, we build a proof-of-concept\nimplementation for a distributed file storage market as a use case. Our\nexperiments show that, compared to a single sidechain-based prior solution,\nchainScale boosts throughput by 4x and reduces confirmation latency by 5x.\nAlso, they show that chainScale outperforms sharding by 2.5x in throughput and\n3.5x in latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "chainScale\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u6df7\u5408\u4fa7\u94fe\u5206\u7247\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u5360\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fa7\u94fe\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d41\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6269\u5bb9\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fa7\u94fe\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fa7\u94fe\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u77ff\u5de5\u5206\u914d\u6280\u672f\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4fa7\u94fe\u540c\u6b65\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e3b\u94fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u552f\u4e00\u771f\u76f8\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u4e22\u5f03\u8fc7\u65f6\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u4fa7\u94fe\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cchainScale\u5c06\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53474\u500d\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e5\u500d\uff1b\u4e0e\u5206\u7247\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53472.5\u500d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e3.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "chainScale\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4fa7\u94fe\u67b6\u6784\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Thus, the\nsecurity of ATT is highly critical for real-world applications. Under the\nscope, we present a new type of attack: distance-pulling attacks (DPA) and a\nsystematic study of it, which exploits vulnerabilities in ATT systems to\ndangerously reduce tracking distances, leading to drone capturing, increased\nsusceptibility to sensor attacks, or even physical collisions. To achieve these\ngoals, we present FlyTrap, a novel physical-world attack framework that employs\nan adversarial umbrella as a deployable and domain-specific attack vector.\nFlyTrap is specifically designed to meet key desired objectives in attacking\nATT drones: physical deployability, closed-loop effectiveness, and\nspatial-temporal consistency. Through novel progressive distance-pulling\nstrategy and controllable spatial-temporal consistency designs, FlyTrap\nmanipulates ATT drones in real-world setups to achieve significant system-level\nimpacts. Our evaluations include new datasets, metrics, and closed-loop\nexperiments on real-world white-box and even commercial ATT drones, including\nDJI and HoverAir. Results demonstrate FlyTrap's ability to reduce tracking\ndistances within the range to be captured, sensor attacked, or even directly\ncrashed, highlighting urgent security risks and practical implications for the\nsafe deployment of ATT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff08ATT\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u7275\u5f15\u653b\u51fb\uff08DPA\uff09\u548cFlyTrap\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u96e8\u4f1e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u8f7d\u4f53\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5371\u9669\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u653b\u51fb\u6216\u7269\u7406\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "motivation": "ATT\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fATT\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff09\u5728\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u8fb9\u5883\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u7834\u574f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64ATT\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlyTrap\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u96e8\u4f1e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7275\u5f15\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u64cd\u7eb5ATT\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aFlyTrap\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8ddd\u79bb\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u53ef\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u653b\u51fb\u751a\u81f3\u76f4\u63a5\u5760\u6bc1\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86ATT\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ATT\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5bf9ATT\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Conversely,\nLLMs excel at code analysis and pattern recognition but can be prone to\ninconsistencies and hallucinations. By integrating these two technologies, a\nmore intelligent and efficient system is created. This combination moves beyond\nmere vulnerability detection optimization, transforming security into a deeply\nintegrated, contextual process that provides tangible benefits like improved\ntriage, dynamic bug descriptions, bug validation via exploit generation and\nenhanced analysis of complex codebases. The result is a more effective security\napproach that leverages the strengths of both technologies while mitigating\ntheir weaknesses. SAST-Genius reduced false positives by about 91 % (225 to 20)\ncompared to Semgrep alone."}

Traditionally, packer detection techniques have relied on empirical\nfeatures, such as high entropy or specific binary patterns. However, these\nempirical, feature-based methods are increasingly vulnerable to evasion by\nadversarial samples or unknown packers (e.g., low-entropy packers).\nFurthermore, the dependence on expert-crafted features poses challenges in\nsustaining and evolving these methods over time.\n  In this paper, we examine the limitations of existing packer detection\nmethods and propose Pack-ALM, a novel deep-learning-based approach for\ndetecting packed executables. Inspired by the linguistic concept of\ndistinguishing between real and pseudo words, we reformulate packer detection\nas a task of differentiating between legitimate and \"pseudo\" instructions. To\nachieve this, we preprocess native data and packed data into \"pseudo\"\ninstructions and design a pre-trained assembly language model that recognizes\nfeatures indicative of packed data. We evaluate Pack-ALM against leading\nindustrial packer detection tools and state-of-the-art assembly language\nmodels. Extensive experiments on over 37,000 samples demonstrate that Pack-ALM\neffectively identifies packed binaries, including samples created with\nadversarial or previously unseen packing techniques. Moreover, Pack-ALM\noutperforms traditional entropy-based methods and advanced assembly language\nmodels in both detection accuracy and adversarial robustness."}

Without requiring additional nodes or extensive\nradio frequency chains, the FAS effectively enables adaptive antenna port\nselection by exploiting channel spatial correlation to enhance the key\ngeneration rate (KGR) at legitimate nodes. To comprehensively evaluate the\nefficiency of the FAS in PLKG, we propose an FAS-assisted PLKG model that\nintegrates transmit beamforming and sparse port selection under independent and\nidentically distributed and spatially correlated channel models, respectively.\nSpecifically, the PLKG utilizes reciprocal channel probing to derive a\nclosed-form KGR expression based on the mutual information between legitimate\nchannel estimates. Nonconvex optimization problems for these scenarios are\nformulated to maximize the KGR subject to transmit power constraints and sparse\nport activation. We propose an iterative algorithm by capitalizing on\nsuccessive convex approximation and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to obtain a\nlocally optimal solution. A reweighted $\\ell_1$-norm-based algorithm is applied\nto advocate for the sparse port activation of FAS-assisted PLKG. Furthermore, a\nlow-complexity sliding window-based port selection is proposed to substitute\nreweighted $\\ell_1$-norm method based on Rayleigh-quotient analysis. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the FAS-PLKG scheme significantly outperforms the\nFA-PLKG scheme in both independent and spatially correlated environments. The\nsliding window-based port selection method introduced in this paper has been\nshown to yield superior KGR, compared to the reweighted $\\ell_1$-norm method.\nIt is shown that the FAS achieves higher KGR with fewer RF chains through\ndynamic sparse port selection."}

This emerging threat has\nquickly attracted research attention, leading to various proposed attack\nvectors, such as hijacking Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers to access\nprivate data. However, most existing approaches lack stealth and persistence,\nlimiting their practical impact.\n  We propose the Cuckoo Attack, a novel attack that achieves stealthy and\npersistent command execution by embedding malicious payloads into configuration\nfiles. These files, commonly used in AI-IDEs, execute system commands during\nroutine operations, without displaying execution details to the user. Once\nconfigured, such files are rarely revisited unless an obvious runtime error\noccurs, creating a blind spot for attackers to exploit. We formalize our attack\nparadigm into two stages, including initial infection and persistence.

Through\ncomprehensive experiments on 10 different network activities, further expanded\nvia in-depth analyses of 21 variants of two specific activities and of 100\nrepetitions of four other ones, we empirically verify that ConCap produces\nnetwork data resembling that of a real-world network.

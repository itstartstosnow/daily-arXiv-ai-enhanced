### [1] [Jailbreaking in the Haystack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04707)
*Rishi Rajesh Shah,Chen Henry Wu,Shashwat Saxena,Ziqian Zhong,Alexander Robey,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: NINJA是一种通过在有害用户目标后附加良性模型生成内容来攻击对齐语言模型的越狱方法，利用目标位置对安全性的重要影响，在长上下文模型中显著提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长上下文语言模型支持百万token输入，其安全影响尚不明确，需要研究扩展上下文带来的安全漏洞。

Method: 通过将有害用户目标放置在模型生成的良性内容之后，利用目标位置对安全性的关键作用进行越狱攻击。

Result: 在HarmBench基准测试中，NINJA显著提高了LLaMA、Qwen、Mistral和Gemini等先进模型的攻击成功率，具有低资源、可转移和难以检测的特点。

Conclusion: 即使是良性的长上下文，当精心设计目标位置时，也会在现代语言模型中引入根本性安全漏洞。

Abstract: Recent advances in long-context language models (LMs) have enabled
million-token inputs, expanding their capabilities across complex tasks like
computer-use agents. Yet, the safety implications of these extended contexts
remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce NINJA (short for
Needle-in-haystack jailbreak attack), a method that jailbreaks aligned LMs by
appending benign, model-generated content to harmful user goals. Critical to
our method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an
important role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench,
show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across
state-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
and Gemini. Unlike prior jailbreaking methods, our approach is low-resource,
transferable, and less detectable. Moreover, we show that NINJA is
compute-optimal -- under a fixed compute budget, increasing context length can
outperform increasing the number of trials in best-of-N jailbreak. These
findings reveal that even benign long contexts -- when crafted with careful
goal positioning -- introduce fundamental vulnerabilities in modern LMs.

### [2] [SWAP: Towards Copyright Auditing of Soft Prompts via Sequential Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04711)
*Wenyuan Yang,Yichen Sun,Changzheng Chen,Zhixuan Chu,Jiaheng Zhang,Yiming Li,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出SWAP方法，通过顺序水印技术保护软提示的版权，解决了现有模型版权审计方法在提示学习场景下的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软提示作为高效适配视觉语言模型的关键模块需要有效的版权保护，但现有模型所有权审计技术由于提示学习的独特特性而失效。

Method: 提出顺序水印技术SWAP，通过在更复杂的空间（防御者指定的分布外类别顺序）中嵌入水印，利用CLIP的零样本预测能力，保持原始预测标签不变。

Result: 在11个数据集上的广泛实验表明SWAP具有有效性、无害性，并能抵抗潜在的自适应攻击。

Conclusion: SWAP通过在不同且更复杂的空间中植入水印，成功解决了软提示版权保护问题，为模型版权审计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models, especially CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable performance across diverse downstream tasks. Soft prompts, as
carefully crafted modules that efficiently adapt vision-language models to
specific tasks, necessitate effective copyright protection. In this paper, we
investigate model copyright protection by auditing whether suspicious
third-party models incorporate protected soft prompts. While this can be viewed
as a special case of model ownership auditing, our analysis shows that existing
techniques are ineffective due to prompt learning's unique characteristics.
Non-intrusive auditing is inherently prone to false positives when independent
models share similar data distributions with victim models. Intrusive
approaches also fail: backdoor methods designed for CLIP cannot embed
functional triggers, while extending traditional DNN backdoor techniques to
prompt learning suffers from harmfulness and ambiguity challenges. We find that
these failures in intrusive auditing stem from the same fundamental reason:
watermarking operates within the same decision space as the primary task yet
pursues opposing objectives. Motivated by these findings, we propose sequential
watermarking for soft prompts (SWAP), which implants watermarks into a
different and more complex space. SWAP encodes watermarks through a specific
order of defender-specified out-of-distribution classes, inspired by the
zero-shot prediction capability of CLIP. This watermark, which is embedded in a
more complex space, keeps the original prediction label unchanged, making it
less opposed to the primary task. We further design a hypothesis-test-guided
verification protocol for SWAP and provide theoretical analyses of success
conditions. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate SWAP's
effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness against potential adaptive attacks.

### [3] [P-MIA: A Profiled-Based Membership Inference Attack on Cognitive Diagnosis Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04716)
*Mingliang Hou,Yinuo Wang,Teng Guo,Zitao Liu,Wenzhou Dou,Jiaqi Zheng,Renqiang Luo,Mi Tian,Weiqi Luo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次系统性地研究了针对认知诊断模型（CDMs）的成员推理攻击，提出了利用模型可解释性特征的灰盒威胁模型和基于特征的成员推理攻击框架，显著优于传统黑盒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知诊断模型在现代智能教育平台中用于创建细粒度学习者档案，但这些模型使用敏感学生数据训练，存在隐私风险。成员推理攻击在其他领域已有研究，但在CDMs中的应用仍是研究空白。

Method: 提出新颖的灰盒威胁模型，利用平台的可解释性特征（如雷达图展示的内部知识状态向量），设计基于特征的成员推理攻击框架（P-MIA），结合模型最终预测概率和暴露的内部知识状态向量作为特征。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上对主流CDMs进行广泛实验，表明灰盒攻击显著优于标准黑盒基线。成功将P-MIA用作审计工具评估机器遗忘技术的有效性并揭示其局限性。

Conclusion: CDMs面临严重的隐私风险，暴露的内部知识状态向量为攻击者提供了强大的攻击面。提出的P-MIA框架不仅能有效实施攻击，还可作为隐私保护的审计工具。

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are pivotal for creating fine-grained
learner profiles in modern intelligent education platforms. However, these
models are trained on sensitive student data, raising significant privacy
concerns. While membership inference attacks (MIA) have been studied in various
domains, their application to CDMs remains a critical research gap, leaving
their privacy risks unquantified. This paper is the first to systematically
investigate MIA against CDMs. We introduce a novel and realistic grey box
threat model that exploits the explainability features of these platforms,
where a model's internal knowledge state vectors are exposed to users through
visualizations such as radar charts. We demonstrate that these vectors can be
accurately reverse-engineered from such visualizations, creating a potent
attack surface. Based on this threat model, we propose a profile-based MIA
(P-MIA) framework that leverages both the model's final prediction
probabilities and the exposed internal knowledge state vectors as features.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets against mainstream CDMs show
that our grey-box attack significantly outperforms standard black-box
baselines. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of P-MIA as an auditing tool by
successfully evaluating the efficacy of machine unlearning techniques and
revealing their limitations.

### [4] [Trustworthiness Calibration Framework for Phishing Email Detection Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04728)
*Daniyal Ganiuly,Assel Smaiyl*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该研究提出了可信度校准框架(TCF)，用于评估钓鱼邮件检测器的可靠性，包括校准度、一致性和鲁棒性三个维度，并通过实验证明GPT-4具有最佳的可信度表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼邮件持续威胁在线通信，虽然LLMs在文本分类中表现优异，但在安全系统中部署需要评估其可靠性，而不仅仅是基准性能。

Method: 引入可信度校准框架(TCF)，包含校准度、一致性和鲁棒性三个评估维度，集成到可信度校准指数(TCI)中，并辅以跨数据集稳定性(CDS)指标。

Result: 在五个语料库上的实验显示，GPT-4具有最强的整体可信度，其次是LLaMA-3-8B和DeBERTa-v3-base，统计证实可靠性与原始准确率独立变化。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于LLM的钓鱼检测模型评估建立了透明可复现的基础，强调了可信度评估对实际部署的重要性。

Abstract: Phishing emails continue to pose a persistent challenge to online
communication, exploiting human trust and evading automated filters through
realistic language and adaptive tactics. While large language models (LLMs)
such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-3-8B achieve strong accuracy in text classification,
their deployment in security systems requires assessing reliability beyond
benchmark performance. To address this, this study introduces the
Trustworthiness Calibration Framework (TCF), a reproducible methodology for
evaluating phishing detectors across three dimensions: calibration,
consistency, and robustness. These components are integrated into a bounded
index, the Trustworthiness Calibration Index (TCI), and complemented by the
Cross-Dataset Stability (CDS) metric that quantifies stability of
trustworthiness across datasets. Experiments conducted on five corpora, such as
SecureMail 2025, Phishing Validation 2024, CSDMC2010, Enron-Spam, and Nazario,
using DeBERTa-v3-base, LLaMA-3-8B, and GPT-4 demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves
the strongest overall trust profile, followed by LLaMA-3-8B and
DeBERTa-v3-base. Statistical analysis confirms that reliability varies
independently of raw accuracy, underscoring the importance of trust-aware
evaluation for real-world deployment. The proposed framework establishes a
transparent and reproducible foundation for assessing model dependability in
LLM-based phishing detection.

### [6] [Bit-Flipping Attack Exploration and Countermeasure in 5G Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04882)
*Joon Kim,Chengwei Duan,Sandip Ray*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文研究了5G系统对位翻转攻击的脆弱性，这是一种完整性攻击，攻击者无需解密即可修改加密消息中的特定字段。通过OpenAirInterface平台测试验证了攻击的现实可行性，并提出了一种基于密钥流的洗牌防御机制来缓解此类攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G通信技术因其高数据速率和低延迟等优势被广泛应用，但现有研究多关注效率优化，安全考虑未得到同等重视，可能留下关键漏洞未被探索。

Method: 在遵循3GPP技术规范的开源5G平台OpenAirInterface上，对位翻转攻击进行严格测试，分析其在当前5G加密机制下的现实可行性和影响。

Result: 研究发现攻击者无需知道明文，仅凭某些字段的语义含义或位置即可实现针对性修改，揭示了5G系统在传输层数据保护方面的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 5G安全需要增强以更好地防范传输过程中的数据篡改攻击，提出的基于密钥流的洗牌防御机制在不增加通信开销的情况下提高了攻击难度。

Abstract: 5G communication technology has become a vital component in a wide range of
applications due to its unique advantages such as high data rate and low
latency. While much of the existing research has focused on optimizing its
efficiency and performance, security considerations have not received
comparable attention, potentially leaving critical vulnerabilities unexplored.
In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of 5G systems to bit-flipping
attacks, which is an integrity attack where an adversary intercepts 5G network
traffic and modifies specific fields of an encrypted message without
decryption, thus mutating the message while remaining valid to the receiver.
Notably, these attacks do not require the attacker to know the plaintext, and
only the semantic meaning or position of certain fields would be enough to
effect targeted modifications. We conduct our analysis on OpenAirInterface
(OAI), an open-source 5G platform that follows the 3GPP Technical
Specifications, to rigorously test the real-world feasibility and impact of
bit-flipping attacks under current 5G encryption mechanisms. Finally, we
propose a keystream-based shuffling defense mechanism to mitigate the effect of
such attacks by raising the difficulty of manipulating specific encrypted
fields, while introducing no additional communication overhead compared to the
NAS Integrity Algorithm (NIA) in 5G. Our findings reveal that enhancements to
5G security are needed to better protect against attacks that alter data during
transmission at the network level.

### [7] [Zero Trust Security Model Implementation in Microservices Architectures Using Identity Federation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04925)
*Rethish Nair Rajendran,Sathish Krishna Anumula,Dileep Kumar Rai,Sachin Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出基于零信任安全模型的微服务生态系统解决方案，使用行业标准身份认证技术来保护分布式工作负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务架构的扩展带来了安全挑战，传统的边界安全策略无法保护分布式工作负载和临时服务交互。

Method: 采用基于行业标准的认证授权技术，包括OpenID Connect、OAuth 2.0令牌交换和SPIFFE/SPIRE工作负载身份。

Result: 实验评估显示该方案具有更小的攻击面、统一策略执行和跨域互操作性，显著提升了安全态势。

Conclusion: 联合身份与零信任原则结合不仅确保认证授权规则，还完全符合DevSecOps标准，为组织在云原生技术中实施零信任提供了严格路线图。

Abstract: The microservice bombshells that have been linked with the microservice
expansion have altered the application architectures, offered agility and
scalability in terms of complexity in security trade-offs. Feeble legacy-based
perimeter-based policies are unable to offer safeguard to distributed workloads
and temporary interaction among and in between the services. The article itself
is a case on the need of the Zero Trust Security Model of micro services
ecosystem, particularly, the fact that human and workloads require identity
federation. It is proposed that the solution framework will be based on
industry-standard authentication and authorization and end-to-end trust
identity technologies, including Authorization and OpenID connect (OIDC),
Authorization and OAuth 2.0 token exchange, and Authorization and SPIFFE/ SPIRE
workload identities. Experimental evaluation is a unique demonstration of a
superior security position of making use of a smaller attack surface, harmony
policy enforcement, as well as interoperability across multi- domain
environments. The research results overlay that the federated identity combined
with the Zero Trust basics not only guarantee the rules relating to
authentication and authorization but also fully complies with the latest
DevSecOps standards of microservice deployment, which is automated, scaled, and
resilient. The current project offers a stringent roadmap to the organizations
that desire to apply Zero Trust in cloud-native technologies but will as well
guarantee adherence and interoperability.

challenges associated with deploying FHE applications remains understudied. We
analyze the impact of storage I/O on the performance of FHE applications and
summarize key lessons from the status quo. Key results include that storage I/O
can degrade the performance of ASICs by as much as 357$\times$ and reduce GPUs
performance by up to 22$\times$.

*Romain Lefeuvre,Charly Reux,Stefano Zacchiroli,Olivier Barais,Benoit Combemale*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种检测分叉仓库中一日漏洞的新方法，通过提交级别的漏洞传播分析，识别未合并修复补丁的分叉项目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有漏洞分析方法缺乏提交级别的粒度，无法跟踪分叉仓库中的漏洞传播，导致一日漏洞可能被遗漏。

Method: 利用Software Heritage存档中的公共代码全局图，在提交级别传播漏洞信息并进行自动化影响分析。

Result: 从7162个包含漏洞提交的仓库中识别出220万个分叉，经过严格筛选找到356个漏洞-分叉对，手动评估发现3个高危漏洞。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测分叉项目中未修复的漏洞，证明了其影响力和实用性。

Abstract: Tracking vulnerabilities inherited from third-party open-source components is
a well-known challenge, often addressed by tracing the threads of dependency
information. However, vulnerabilities can also propagate through forking: a
repository forked after the introduction of a vulnerability, but before it is
patched, may remain vulnerable in the fork well after being fixed in the
original project. Current approaches for vulnerability analysis lack the
commit-level granularity needed to track vulnerability introductions and fixes
across forks, potentially leaving one-day vulnerabilities undetected. This
paper presents a novel approach to help developers identify one-day
vulnerabilities in forked repositories. Leveraging the global graph of public
code, as captured by the Software Heritage archive, the approach propagates
vulnerability information at the commit level and performs automated impact
analysis. This enables automatic detection of forked projects that have not
incorporated fixes, leaving them potentially vulnerable. Starting from 7162
repositories that, according to OSV, include vulnerable commits in their
development histories, we identify 2.2 M forks, containing at least one
vulnerable commit. Then we perform a strict filtering, allowing us to find 356
___vulnerability, fork___ pairs impacting active and popular GitHub forks, we
manually evaluate 65 pairs, finding 3 high-severity vulnerabilities,
demonstrating the impact and applicability of this approach.

### [10] [TRICK: Time and Range Integrity ChecK using Low Earth Orbiting Satellite for Securing GNSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05100)
*Arslan Mumtaz,Mridula Singh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TRICK是一种安全定位原语，通过结合LEO卫星的双向测距和GNSS广播信号的单向测距，提供与可验证多边定位相同的安全保障，但只需与单个参考节点建立双向通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GNSS在安全关键和高精度应用中广泛使用，但仍易受欺骗攻击。现有的加密增强（如伽利略系统的TESLA协议）无法缓解到达时间操纵问题。

Method: 提出TRICK方法，仅需与单个LEO参考卫星建立双向通信，并结合多个广播导航信号。通过将LEO卫星的双向测距和GNSS广播信号的单向测距结合到椭球约束中，恢复可验证多边定位的保证。

Result: 详细分析表明，该方法能可靠检测欺骗攻击，同时仅增加可忽略的计算开销。

Conclusion: TRICK提供了一种基础设施需求最小、消息交换最少的安全定位解决方案，填补了现有GNSS安全增强的空白。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide Positioning, Navigation,
and Timing (PNT) information to over 4 billion devices worldwide. Despite its
pervasive use in safety critical and high precision applications, GNSS remains
vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Cryptographic enhancements, such as the use of
TESLA protocol in Galileo, to provide navigation message authentication do not
mitigate time of arrival manipulations. In this paper, we propose TRICK, a
primitive for secure positioning that closes this gap by introducing a
fundamentally new approach that only requires two way communications with a
single reference node along with multiple broadcast signals. Unlike classical
Verifiable Multilateration (VM), which requires establishing two way
communication with each reference nodes, our solution relies on only two
measurements with a trusted Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellite and combines
broadcast navigation signals. We rigorously prove that combining the LEO
satellite based two way range measurements and multiple one way ranges such as
from broadcast signals of GNSS into ellipsoidal constraint restores the same
guarantees as offered by VM whilst using minimal infrastructure and message
exchanges. Through detailed analysis, we show that our approach reliably
detects spoofing attempts while adding negligible computation overhead.

### [11] [Quantifying the Risk of Transferred Black Box Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05102)
*Disesdi Susanna Cox,Niklas Bunzel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对对抗性转移攻击的定向韧性测试框架，通过基于CKA相似度策略选择替代模型来优化对抗性子空间的覆盖，并使用基于回归的估计器进行风险评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着神经网络在安全相关产品中的广泛应用，对抗性攻击的脆弱性成为重要关切。新兴法规和标准强调安全性，组织需要可靠量化这些攻击的风险，特别是转移性对抗攻击，其准确评估仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出定向韧性测试框架，策略性地选择基于中心核对齐(CKA)相似度的替代模型，利用高和低CKA相似度的替代模型来优化对抗性子空间的覆盖，并使用回归基估计器进行风险估计。

Result: 该方法能够提供现实且可操作的风险量化，解决了在高维输入空间中实现完整测试覆盖的计算不可行性问题。

Conclusion: 通过基于CKA相似度的定向测试框架，可以有效缓解对抗性风险映射的不实用性，为组织提供可靠的对抗性风险评估方法。

Abstract: Neural networks have become pervasive across various applications, including
security-related products. However, their widespread adoption has heightened
concerns regarding vulnerability to adversarial attacks. With emerging
regulations and standards emphasizing security, organizations must reliably
quantify risks associated with these attacks, particularly regarding
transferred adversarial attacks, which remain challenging to evaluate
accurately. This paper investigates the complexities involved in resilience
testing against transferred adversarial attacks. Our analysis specifically
addresses black-box evasion attacks, highlighting transfer-based attacks due to
their practical significance and typically high transferability between neural
network models. We underline the computational infeasibility of exhaustively
exploring high-dimensional input spaces to achieve complete test coverage. As a
result, comprehensive adversarial risk mapping is deemed impractical. To
mitigate this limitation, we propose a targeted resilience testing framework
that employs surrogate models strategically selected based on Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA) similarity. By leveraging surrogate models exhibiting both high
and low CKA similarities relative to the target model, the proposed approach
seeks to optimize coverage of adversarial subspaces. Risk estimation is
conducted using regression-based estimators, providing organizations with
realistic and actionable risk quantification.

### [12] [PhantomFetch: Obfuscating Loads against Prefetcher Side-Channel Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05110)
*Xingzhi Zhang,Buyi Lv,Yimin Lu,Kai Bu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PhantomFetch是一种针对IP-stride预取器侧信道攻击的防御方案，能够在保留预取性能的同时提供硬件无关的安全保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IP-stride预取器被利用来通过侧信道攻击泄露秘密，但简单地禁用预取器会牺牲性能。现有防御方案需要硬件修改，存在重新制造成本且无法应用于现成设备。

Method: 通过混淆受害者的敏感加载效果，直接打破训练预取器条目与受害者秘密相关加载之间的可利用耦合关系。

Result: 实验结果显示PhantomFetch能够以可忽略的开销保护IP-stride预取器的安全性。

Conclusion: PhantomFetch是首个保留预取效果且硬件无关的防御方案，避免了重新制造成本并扩展了在现成设备上的适用性。

Abstract: The IP-stride prefetcher has recently been exploited to leak secrets through
side-channel attacks. It, however, cannot be simply disabled for security with
prefetching speedup as a sacrifice. The state-of-the-art defense tries to
retain the prefetching effect by hardware modification. In this paper, we
present PhantomFetch as the first prefetching-retentive and hardware-agnostic
defense. It avoids potential remanufacturing cost and enriches applicability to
off-the-shelf devices. The key idea is to directly break the exploitable
coupling between trained prefetcher entries and the victim's secret-dependent
loads by obfuscating the sensitive load effects of the victim. The experiment
results show that PhantomFetch can secure the IP-stride prefetcher with only
negligible overhead.

### [13] [Confidentiality in a Card-Based Protocol Under Repeated Biased Shuffles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05111)
*Do Hyun Kim,Ahmet Cetinkaya*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文分析了五张纸牌戏法协议中的保密性问题，发现由于玩家无意识的行为导致随机切牌存在偏差，从而造成信息泄露。通过马尔可夫链特征结构推导了减少泄露所需的重复切牌次数界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究纸牌协议中的保密性，特别是Bert den Boer的五张纸牌戏法协议。由于玩家在切牌时倾向于移动纸牌而非保持原状，导致随机切牌分布不均匀，为恶意玩家提供了猜测对方选择的机会。

Method: 使用概率分析方法，计算恶意玩家猜测对方选择的概率来量化信息泄露。利用马尔可夫链的特征结构推导减少信息泄露所需的重复切牌次数界限。

Result: 发现非均匀的切牌分布确实会造成信息泄露，通过马尔可夫链分析得到了减少泄露所需重复切牌次数的严格界限。

Conclusion: 五张纸牌戏法协议中的随机切牌偏差会导致信息泄露，需要通过多次重复切牌来降低泄露风险。该方法可推广到恶意玩家进行洗牌的场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a probabilistic analysis of the confidentiality in
a card-based protocol. We focus on Bert den Boer's original Five Card Trick to
develop our approach. Five Card Trick was formulated as a secure two-party
computation method, where two players use colored cards with identical backs to
calculate the logical AND operation on the bits that they choose. In this
method, the players first arrange the cards privately, and then shuffle them
through a random cut. Finally, they reveal the shuffled arrangement to
determine the result of the operation. An unbiased random cut is essential to
prevent players from exposing their chosen bits to each other. However, players
typically choose to move cards within the deck even though not moving any cards
should be equally likely. This unconscious behavior results in a biased,
nonuniform shuffling-distribution in the sense that some arrangements of cards
are slightly more probable after the cut. Such a nonuniform distribution
creates an opportunity for a malicious player to gain advantage in guessing the
other player's choice. We provide the conditional probabilities of such guesses
as a way to quantify the information leakage. Furthermore, we utilize the
eigenstructure of a Markov chain to derive tight bounds on the number of times
the biased random cuts must be repeated to reduce the leakage to an acceptable
level. We also discuss the generalization of our approach to the setting where
shuffling is conducted by a malicious player.

TL;DR: CAI在Dragos OT CTF 2025竞赛中表现优异，早期阶段超越人类团队，但在持续多日操作中存在实际限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估网络安全AI在工业控制系统安全竞赛中的表现，量化其相对于顶尖人类团队的能力。

Method: 使用CAI遥测数据和官方排行榜数据，分析时间分辨得分、类别覆盖和解题节奏。

Result: CAI在7-8小时内达到第一名，以1846分/小时的速度在5.42小时达到10000分，完成34个挑战中的32个，最终排名第6。

Conclusion: 任务配置的AI代理在早期OT事件响应中可以匹配或超越专家人类团队，但在持续多日操作中仍存在限制。

Abstract: Operational Technology (OT) cybersecurity increasingly relies on rapid
response across malware analysis, network forensics, and reverse engineering
disciplines. We examine the performance of Cybersecurity AI (CAI), powered by
the \texttt{alias1} model, during the Dragos OT CTF 2025 -- a 48-hour
industrial control system (ICS) competition with more than 1,000 teams. Using
CAI telemetry and official leaderboard data, we quantify CAI's trajectory
relative to the leading human-operated teams. CAI reached Rank~1 between
competition hours 7.0 and 8.0, crossed 10,000 points at 5.42~hours
(1,846~pts/h), and completed 32 of the competition's 34 challenges before
automated operations were paused at hour~24 with a final score of 18,900 points
(6th place). The top-3 human teams solved 33 of 34 challenges, collectively
leaving only the 600-point ``Kiddy Tags -- 1'' unsolved; they were also the
only teams to clear the 1,000-point ``Moot Force'' binary. The top-5 human
teams averaged 1,347~pts/h to the same milestone, marking a 37\% velocity
advantage for CAI. We analyse time-resolved scoring, category coverage, and

match or exceed expert human crews in early-phase OT incident response while
remaining subject to practical limits in sustained, multi-day operations.

Result: 基于真实数据集的数值结果显示，sIBN系统在二分类和多分类任务中均取得最佳性能，各项标准评估指标表现优异，同时保持低错误率。

Conclusion: sIBN系统能有效保护用户意图免受对抗性篡改，解决了IBN系统中意图完整性信任假设的安全盲点问题。

Abstract: While Intent-Based Networking (IBN) promises operational efficiency through
autonomous and abstraction-driven network management, a critical unaddressed
issue lies in IBN's implicit trust in the integrity of intent ingested by the
network. This inherent assumption of data reliability creates a blind spot
exploitable by Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, where an adversary intercepts
and alters intent before it is enacted, compelling the network to orchestrate
malicious configurations. This study proposes a secured IBN (sIBN) system with
data driven intrusion detection method designed to secure legitimate user
intent from adversarial tampering. The proposed intent intrusion detection
system uses a ML model applied for network behavioral anomaly detection to
reveal temporal patterns of intent tampering. This is achieved by leveraging a
set of original behavioral metrics and newly engineered time-aware features,
with the model's hyperparameters fine-tuned through the randomized search
cross-validation (RSCV) technique. Numerical results based on real-world data
sets, show the effectiveness of sIBN, achieving the best performance across
standard evaluation metrics, in both binary and multi classification tasks,
while maintaining low error rates.

Abstract: With more and more existing networks being transformed to Software-Defined
Networking (SDN), they need to be more secure and demand smarter ways of
traffic control. This work, SmartSecChain-SDN, is a platform that combines
machine learning based intrusion detection, blockchain-based storage of logs,
and application-awareness-based priority in SDN networks. To detect network
intrusions in a real-time, precision and low-false positives setup, the
framework utilizes the application of advanced machine learning algorithms,
namely Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and CNN-BiLSTM. SmartSecChain-SDN is
based on the Hyperledger Fabric, which is a permissioned blockchain technology,
to provide secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving storage and, thus,
guarantee that the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) records cannot be altered
and can be analyzed comprehensively. The system also has Quality of Service
(QoS) rules and traffic shaping based on applications, which enables
prioritization of critical services, such as VoIP, video conferencing, and
business applications, as well as de-prioritization of non-essential traffic,
such as downloads and updates. Mininet can simulate real-time SDN scenarios
because it is used to prototype whole architectures. It is also compatible with
controllers OpenDaylight and Ryu. It has tested the framework using the InSDN
dataset and proved that it can identify different kinds of cyberattacks and
handle bandwidth allocation efficiently under circumstances of resource
constraints. SmartSecChain-SDN comprehensively addresses SDN system protection,
securing and enhancing. The proposed study offers an innovative, extensible way
to improve cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, and the administration of
next-generation programmable networks.

*Zhibo Dong,Yong Huang,Shubao Sun,Wentao Cui,Zhihua Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出BLADE系统，一种无监督流量异常检测方法，能够检测网络服务中的流级和行为级攻击，通过多流视角分析应用层操作在网络层的通信模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流量异常检测方法主要关注流级攻击，但无法识别行为级攻击，这类攻击在单个流中看似良性，但在多个网络流中表现出恶意目的。

Method: 使用流自动编码器学习潜在特征表示并计算重构损失，通过无监督聚类分配伪操作标签，基于重构损失计算异常分数，最后将时间戳、伪标签和异常分数的三元组聚合输入单类分类器来表征合法网络操作的行为模式。

Result: 在自定义数据集和CIC-IDS2017数据集上的评估显示，BLADE在两个数据集上分别实现了0.9732和0.9801的高F1分数，优于传统的单流异常检测基线方法。

Conclusion: BLADE系统能够有效检测流级和行为级异常，通过多流视角分析应用层操作在网络层的通信模式，在流量异常检测方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: With their widespread popularity, web services have become the main targets
of various cyberattacks. Existing traffic anomaly detection approaches focus on
flow-level attacks, yet fail to recognize behavior-level attacks, which appear
benign in individual flows but reveal malicious purpose using multiple network
flows. To transcend this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised traffic
anomaly detection system, BLADE, capable of detecting not only flow-level but
also behavior-level attacks in web services. Our key observation is that
application-layer operations of web services exhibit distinctive communication
patterns at the network layer from a multi-flow perspective. BLADE first
exploits a flow autoencoder to learn a latent feature representation and
calculates its reconstruction losses per flow. Then, the latent representation
is assigned a pseudo operation label using an unsupervised clustering method.
Next, an anomaly score is computed based on the reconstruction losses. Finally,
the triplets of timestamps, pseudo labels, and anomaly scores from multiple
flows are aggregated and fed into a one-class classifier to characterize the
behavior patterns of legitimate web operations, enabling the detection of
flow-level and behavior-level anomalies. BLADE is extensively evaluated on both
the custom dataset and the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The experimental results
demonstrate BLADE's superior performance, achieving high F1 scores of 0.9732
and 0.9801, respectively, on the two datasets, and outperforming traditional
single-flow anomaly detection baselines.

### [18] [ConVerse: Benchmarking Contextual Safety in Agent-to-Agent Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05359)
*Amr Gomaa,Ahmed Salem,Sahar Abdelnabi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ConVerse是一个用于评估多智能体交互中隐私和安全风险的动态基准，涵盖旅行、房地产、保险三个领域，包含864种上下文攻击。评估显示最先进模型存在严重漏洞，隐私攻击成功率高达88%，安全漏洞达60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型发展为自主代理，在多智能体生态系统中确保安全性成为核心挑战。智能体间协作需要在信息共享与保护之间取得平衡，每个交互都会产生新的攻击面。

Method: 构建ConVerse基准，包含三个实际领域、12个用户角色和864种上下文攻击。模拟自主的多轮智能体间对话，将恶意请求嵌入合理对话中。隐私攻击采用三层分类法评估抽象质量，安全攻击针对工具使用和偏好操纵。

Result: 评估7个最先进模型显示持续存在的漏洞：隐私攻击成功率高达88%，安全漏洞达60%，且更强的模型泄露更多信息。

Conclusion: 通过在多智能体交互环境中统一隐私和安全，ConVerse将安全性重新定义为通信的涌现属性。

Abstract: As language models evolve into autonomous agents that act and communicate on
behalf of users, ensuring safety in multi-agent ecosystems becomes a central
challenge. Interactions between personal assistants and external service
providers expose a core tension between utility and protection: effective
collaboration requires information sharing, yet every exchange creates new
attack surfaces. We introduce ConVerse, a dynamic benchmark for evaluating
privacy and security risks in agent-agent interactions. ConVerse spans three
practical domains (travel, real estate, insurance) with 12 user personas and
over 864 contextually grounded attacks (611 privacy, 253 security). Unlike
prior single-agent settings, it models autonomous, multi-turn agent-to-agent
conversations where malicious requests are embedded within plausible discourse.
Privacy is tested through a three-tier taxonomy assessing abstraction quality,
while security attacks target tool use and preference manipulation. Evaluating
seven state-of-the-art models reveals persistent vulnerabilities; privacy
attacks succeed in up to 88% of cases and security breaches in up to 60%, with
stronger models leaking more. By unifying privacy and security within
interactive multi-agent contexts, ConVerse reframes safety as an emergent
property of communication.

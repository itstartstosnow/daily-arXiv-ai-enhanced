Instead of relying on speculative\nbeliefs, it frames the asset's price within a Rational-Expectations\nSecurity-Utility Nash Equilibrium (RESUNE). This equilibrium is a fixed point\nwhere the market-clearing price dictates the hash rate through a free-entry\nmining model, which in turn endogenously sets the network's security. The\nsecurity, defined as one minus the probability of a 51% attack, is determined\nvia a global games model of attacker coordination, providing a unique and\ncontinuous security function. We prove the existence of a RESUNE and offer\nconditions for its uniqueness and stability. The model predicts that the\nstabilizing direct effect of price on demand must outweigh the potentially\ndestabilizing feedback from price to security. The framework generates testable\npredictions, such as a protocol halving causing a contraction in both hash rate\nand price. A structural Vector Autoregression (VAR) model is proposed to test\nthis mechanism. The model decomposes Bitcoin's value into transactional\nutility, security, and speculative components and explains the observed\nunidirectional causality from price to hash rate."}

Using Graph\nNeural Networks to detect these threats has become a research focus and has\ndemonstrated exceptional performance. However, the widespread adoption of\nGNN-based security models is limited by their inherent black-box nature, as\nthey fail to provide security analysts with any verifiable explanations for\nmodel predictions or any evidence regarding the model's judgment in relation to\nreal-world attacks. To address this challenge, we propose ProvX, an effective\nexplanation framework for exlaining GNN-based security models on provenance\ngraphs. ProvX introduces counterfactual explanation logic, seeking the minimal\nstructural subset within a graph predicted as malicious that, when perturbed,\ncan subvert the model's original prediction. We innovatively transform the\ndiscrete search problem of finding this critical subgraph into a continuous\noptimization task guided by a dual objective of prediction flipping and\ndistance minimization. Furthermore, a Staged Solidification strategy is\nincorporated to enhance the precision and stability of the explanations. We\nconducted extensive evaluations of ProvX on authoritative datasets. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that ProvX can locate critical graph\nstructures that are highly relevant to real-world attacks and achieves an\naverage explanation necessity of 51.59\\%, with these metrics outperforming\ncurrent SOTA explainers. Furthermore, we explore and provide a preliminary\nvalidation of a closed-loop Detection-Explanation-Feedback enhancement\nframework, demonstrating through experiments that the explanation results from\nProvX can guide model optimization, effectively enhancing its robustness\nagainst adversarial attacks."}

However, current work focuses on user-oriented\nprivacy, overlooking severe enterprise data leakage risks exacerbated by the\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation paradigm. To address this gap, our paper\nintroduces a novel objective: enterprise-oriented privacy concerns. Achieving\nthis objective requires overcoming two fundamental challenges: existing methods\nsuch as data sanitization severely degrade model performance, and the field\nlacks public datasets for evaluation. We address these challenges with several\nsolutions. (1) To prevent performance degradation, we propose ABack, a\ntraining-free mechanism that leverages a Hidden State Model to pinpoint the\norigin of a leakage intention and rewrite the output safely. (2) To solve the\nlack of datasets, we construct PriGenQA, a new benchmark for enterprise privacy\nscenarios in healthcare and finance. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we move\nbeyond simple static attacks by developing a powerful adaptive attacker with\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization.

These attacks easily bypass existing\ndefenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To\naddress this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided\nCoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based\non two key insights. First, to counteract the model's oversensitivity to\ntriggers, we propose a Key-extraction-guided Chain-of-Thought (KCoT). Instead\nof only considering the single trigger or the input sentence, KCoT prompts the\nagent to extract task-relevant key phrases. Second, to guide the LLM toward\ncorrect answers, our proposed Soft Label Mechanism (SLM) prompts the agent to\nquantify the semantic correlation between key phrases and candidate answers.\nCrucially, to mitigate the influence of residual triggers or misleading content\nin phrases extracted by KCoT, which typically causes anomalous scores, SLM\nexcludes anomalous scores deviating significantly from the mean and\nsubsequently averages the remaining scores to derive a more reliable semantic\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments on classification and question-answer\n(QA) tasks demonstrate that SLIP is highly effective, reducing the average\nattack success rate (ASR) from 90.2% to 25.13% while maintaining high accuracy\non clean data and outperforming state-of-the-art defenses.

However, the protection algorithms\nwould become ineffective when forgery attackers apply purification techniques\nto bypass the protection. To address this issue, we present a novel approach,\nAnti-Tamper Perturbation (ATP). ATP introduces a tamper-proof mechanism within\nthe perturbation. It consists of protection and authorization perturbations,\nwhere the protection perturbation defends against forgery attacks, while the\nauthorization perturbation detects purification-based tampering. Both\nprotection and authorization perturbations are applied in the frequency domain\nunder the guidance of a mask, ensuring that the protection perturbation does\nnot disrupt the authorization perturbation. This design also enables the\nauthorization perturbation to be distributed across all image pixels,\npreserving its sensitivity to purification-based tampering.

Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based\nagents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal\nhuman intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost\nsavings.\n  In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions,\nshowing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security\ncost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to\nmislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the\ninfrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject\ntelemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior\nthrough a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system\nerror interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack\nmethodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing,\nand LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior\nknowledge of the target system.\n  To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that\nsanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal\nrole of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably\nblocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance.\n  Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system\ncompromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design."}

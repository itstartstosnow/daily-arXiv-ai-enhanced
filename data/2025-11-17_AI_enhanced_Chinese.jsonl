However, existing methods rely on the specific information mechanisms of target HGNNs, overlooking the common vulnerability caused by the significant differences in hyperedge pivotality along aggregation paths in most HGNNs, thereby limiting the transferability and effectiveness of attacks. In this paper, we present a novel framework, i.e., Transferable Hypergraph Attack via Injecting Nodes into Pivotal Hyperedges (TH-Attack), to address these limitations. Specifically, we design a hyperedge recognizer via pivotality assessment to obtain pivotal hyperedges within the aggregation paths of HGNNs. Furthermore, we introduce a feature inverter based on pivotal hyperedges, which generates malicious nodes by maximizing the semantic divergence between the generated features and the pivotal hyperedges features. Lastly, by injecting these malicious nodes into the pivotal hyperedges, TH-Attack improves the transferability and effectiveness of attacks. Extensive experiments are conducted on six authentic datasets to validate the effectiveness of TH-Attack and the corresponding superiority to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTH-Attack\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u8fb9\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u6076\u610f\u8282\u70b9\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d85\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5927\u591a\u6570HGNN\u4e2d\u6cbf\u805a\u5408\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8d85\u8fb9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8d85\u8fb9\u8bc6\u522b\u5668\u83b7\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u8fb9\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u8fb9\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53cd\u8f6c\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6076\u610f\u8282\u70b9\uff1b\u5c06\u6076\u610f\u8282\u70b9\u6ce8\u5165\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u8fb9\u6765\u5b9e\u65bd\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86TH-Attack\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TH-Attack\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u8fb9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose BadThink, the first backdoor attack designed to deliberately induce \"overthinking\" behavior in CoT-enabled LLMs while ensuring stealth. When activated by carefully crafted trigger prompts, BadThink manipulates the model to generate inflated reasoning traces - producing unnecessarily redundant thought processes while preserving the consistency of final outputs. This subtle attack vector creates a covert form of performance degradation that significantly increases computational costs and inference time while remaining difficult to detect through conventional output evaluation methods. We implement this attack through a sophisticated poisoning-based fine-tuning strategy, employing a novel LLM-based iterative optimization process to embed the behavior by generating highly naturalistic poisoned data. Our experiments on multiple state-of-the-art models and reasoning tasks show that BadThink consistently increases reasoning trace lengths - achieving an over 17x increase on the MATH-500 dataset - while remaining stealthy and robust.

Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks.

A general guiding mechanism adopted in existing directed fuzzers is to calculate the control-flow distance between the current progress and the target, and use that as feedback to guide the directed fuzzing. A fundamental problem with the existing guiding mechanism is that the distance calculation is \\emph{feasibility-unaware}.\n  In this work, we propose feasibility-aware directed fuzzing named AFLGopher. Our new feasibility-aware distance calculation provides pragmatic feedback to guide directed fuzzing to reach targets efficiently. We propose new techniques to address the challenges of feasibility prediction. Our new classification method allows us to predict the feasibility of all branches based on limited traces, and our runtime feasibility-updating mechanism gradually and efficiently improves the prediction precision. We implemented AFLGopher and compared AFLGopher with state-of-the-art directed fuzzers including AFLGo, enhanced AFLGo, WindRanger, BEACON and SelectFuzz. AFLGopher is 3.76x, 2.57x, 3.30x, 2.52x and 2.86x faster than AFLGo, BEACON, WindRanger, SelectFuzz and enhanced AFLGo, respectively, in reaching targets. AFLGopher is 5.60x, 5.20x, 4.98x, 4.52x, and 5.07x faster than AFLGo, BEACON, WindRanger, SelectFuzz and enhanced AFLGo, respectively, in triggering known vulnerabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "AFLGopher\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u89e6\u53d1\u5df2\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b9a\u5411\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5224\u65ad\u54ea\u4e9b\u8def\u5f84\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6240\u6709\u5206\u652f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "AFLGopher\u5728\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5feb2.52-3.76\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u89e6\u53d1\u5df2\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e0a\u5feb4.52-5.60\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\uff0cAFLGopher\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Armadillo is designed for federated learning setting, where a single powerful server interacts with many weak clients iteratively to train models on client's private data. While a few prior works consider disruption resistance under such setting, they either incur high per-client cost (Chowdhury et al. CCS '22) or require many rounds (Bell et al. USENIX Security '23). Although disruption resistance can be achieved generically with zero-knowledge proof techniques (which we also use in this paper), we realize an efficient system with two new designs: 1) a simple two-layer secure aggregation protocol that requires only simple arithmetic computation; 2) an agreement protocol that removes the effect of malicious clients from the aggregation with low round complexity. With these techniques, Armadillo completes each secure aggregation in 3 rounds while keeping the server and clients computationally lightweight.", "AI": {"tldr": "Armadillo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6297\u7834\u574f\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u5fa1\u6076\u610f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u53ea\u53d7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5728\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5408\u6cd5\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8bef\u62a5\u79c1\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u8981\u4e48\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u591a\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\u3002Armadillo\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6297\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5c11\u8f6e\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u672f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u534f\u8bae\u79fb\u9664\u6076\u610f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5bf9\u805a\u5408\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8f6e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "Armadillo\u6bcf\u8f6e\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u4ec5\u97003\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8f7b\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Armadillo\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4e24\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u6076\u610f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u79fb\u9664\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6297\u7834\u574f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the emergence of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we investigate the intersection of diffusion-based image editing and robust image watermarking. We analyze how diffusion-driven image edits can significantly degrade or even fully remove embedded watermarks from state-of-the-art robust watermarking systems. Both theoretical formulations and empirical experiments are provided. We prove that as a image undergoes iterative diffusion transformations, the mutual information between the watermarked image and the embedded payload approaches zero, causing watermark decoding to fail. We further propose a guided diffusion attack algorithm that explicitly targets and erases watermark signals during generation. We evaluate our approach on recent deep learning-based watermarking schemes and demonstrate near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual fidelity of the regenerated images.

Competitive genres-such as Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), First Person Shooter (FPS), Real Time Strategy (RTS), and Action games-remain underexplored due to the difficulty of detecting cheating users and the demand for complex data and techniques. To address this gap, many game companies rely on kernel-level anti-cheat solutions, which, while effective, raise serious concerns regarding user privacy and system security. In this paper, we propose GYNOPTICON, a novel cheating detection framework that leverages user consensus to identify abnormal behavior. GYNOPTICON integrates a lightweight client-side detection mechanism with a server-side voting system: when suspicious activity is identified, clients cast votes to the server, which aggregates them to establish consensus and distinguish cheaters from legitimate players. This architecture enables transparency, reduces reliance on intrusive monitoring, and mitigates privacy risks. We evaluate GYNOPTICON in both a controlled simulation and a real-world FPS environment.

However, manual patching is both time-consuming and resource-intensive, while existing automated vulnerability repair (AVR) techniques remain limited in effectiveness. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened a new paradigm for AVR, demonstrating remarkable progress. To examine the capability of LLMs in AVR, several vulnerability benchmarks have been proposed recently. However, they still suffer from key limitations of outdated vulnerabilities, limited language coverage, unreliable patch validation, and insufficient reproducibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PATCHEVAL, a multilingual benchmark for Go, JavaScript, and Python, languages for which existing benchmarks remain unexplored. PATCHEVAL curates a dataset of 1,000 vulnerabilities drawn from CVEs reported between 2015 and 2025, covering 65 distinct CWEs. A subset of 230 CVEs is further equipped with runtime sandbox environments, enabling patch verification through both security tests and functionality tests.

We analyzed eight attack scenarios in four categories: architectural attacks on convolutional neural networks, large language models, and reinforcement learning agents; infrastructure attacks exploiting federated learning and medical documentation systems; critical resource allocation attacks affecting organ transplantation and crisis triage; and supply chain attacks targeting commercial foundation models. Our findings indicate that attackers with access to only 100-500 samples can compromise healthcare AI regardless of dataset size, often achieving over 60 percent success, with detection taking an estimated 6 to 12 months or sometimes not occurring at all. The distributed nature of healthcare infrastructure creates many entry points where insiders with routine access can launch attacks with limited technical skill. Privacy laws such as HIPAA and GDPR can unintentionally shield attackers by restricting the analyses needed for detection. Supply chain weaknesses allow a single compromised vendor to poison models across 50 to 200 institutions. The Medical Scribe Sybil scenario shows how coordinated fake patient visits can poison data through legitimate clinical workflows without requiring a system breach. Current regulations lack mandatory adversarial robustness testing, and federated learning can worsen risks by obscuring attribution. We recommend multilayer defenses including required adversarial testing, ensemble-based detection, privacy-preserving security mechanisms, and international coordination on AI security standards.

Neither meets 5G New Radio (NR)-V2X's stringent requirements for both immediate authentication and computational efficiency. This paper presents SALT-V, a novel hybrid authentication framework that reconciles this fundamental trade-off through intelligent protocol stratification. SALT-V employs ECDSA signatures for 10% of traffic (BOOT frames) to establish sender trust, then leverages this trust anchor to authenticate 90% of messages (DATA frames) using lightweight GMAC operations. The core innovation - an Ephemeral Session Tag (EST) whitelist mechanism - enables 95% of messages to achieve immediate verification without waiting for key disclosure, while Bloom filter integration provides O(1) revocation checking in 1 us. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SALT-V achieves 0.035 ms average computation time (57x faster than pure ECDSA), 1 ms end-to-end latency, 41-byte overhead, and linear scalability to 2000 vehicles, making it the first practical solution to satisfy all safety-critical requirements for real-time V2X deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SALT-V\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8bae\u5206\u5c42\u89e3\u51b3V2X\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ECDSA\u8ba4\u8bc110%\u6d41\u91cf\u5efa\u7acb\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c90%\u6d88\u606f\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cfGMAC\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b00.035ms\u5e73\u5747\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u548c1ms\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3V2X\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u516c\u94a5\u65b9\u6848\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff082ms\uff09\u4e0e\u5bf9\u79f0\u65b9\u6848\u5bc6\u94a5\u62ab\u9732\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fc7\u957f\uff0820-100ms\uff09\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db35G NR-V2X\u5bf9\u5373\u65f6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff1aECDSA\u7b7e\u540d\u8ba4\u8bc110%\u7684BOOT\u5e27\u5efa\u7acb\u53d1\u9001\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u4efb\u951a\u70b9\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cfGMAC\u8ba4\u8bc190%\u7684DATA\u5e27\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u4e34\u65f6\u4f1a\u8bdd\u6807\u7b7e\u767d\u540d\u5355\u673a\u5236\u548cBloom\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b095%\u6d88\u606f\u5373\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c1us\u7684O(1)\u64a4\u9500\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u5e73\u5747\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f40.035ms\uff08\u6bd4\u7eafECDSA\u5feb57\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf1ms\uff0c\u5f00\u950041\u5b57\u8282\uff0c\u53ef\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u52302000\u8f86\u8f66\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5b9e\u65f6V2X\u90e8\u7f72\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "SALT-V\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8c03\u548c\u4e86V2X\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6V2X\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, its current lack of support for capturing and reasoning about SSC threat propagation makes it unsuitable for addressing modern SSC attacks, such as the XZ compromise or the 3CX double SSC attack.

In federated learning (FL), where data remains distributed across multiple parties during collaborative model training, normalization presents unique challenges due to the decentralized and often heterogeneous nature of the data. Traditional methods rely on either independent client-side processing, i.e., local normalization, or normalizing the entire dataset before distributing it to parties, i.e., pooled normalization. Local normalization can be problematic when data distributions across parties are non-IID, while the pooled normalization approach conflicts with the decentralized nature of FL. In this paper, we explore the adaptation of widely used normalization techniques to FL and define the term federated normalization. Federated normalization simulates pooled normalization by enabling the collaborative exchange of normalization parameters among parties. Thus, it achieves performance on par with pooled normalization without compromising data locality. However, sharing normalization parameters such as the mean introduces potential privacy risks, which we further mitigate through a robust privacy-preserving solution. Our contributions include: (i) We systematically evaluate the impact of various federated and local normalization techniques in heterogeneous FL scenarios, (ii) We propose a novel homomorphically encrypted $k$-th ranked element (and median) calculation tailored for the federated setting, enabling secure and efficient federated normalization, (iii) We propose privacy-preserving implementations of widely used normalization techniques for FL, leveraging multiparty fully homomorphic encryption (MHE).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u4ea4\u6362\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u672c\u5730\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8fdd\u80cc\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u90a6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u8ba1\u7b97k\u9636\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u8054\u90a6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u90a6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u662f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to detect OWASP-inspired vulnerabilities in smart contracts beyond the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, focusing specifically on Solana and Algorand. Given the lack of labeled datasets for non-EVM platforms, we design a synthetic dataset of annotated smart contract snippets in Rust (for Solana) and PyTeal (for Algorand), structured around a vulnerability taxonomy derived from OWASP. We evaluate LLMs under three configurations: prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and a hybrid of both, comparing their performance on different vulnerability categories. Experimental results show that prompt engineering achieves general robustness, while fine-tuning improves precision and recall on less semantically rich languages such as TEAL. Additionally, we analyze how the architectural differences of Solana and Algorand influence the manifestation and detectability of vulnerabilities, offering platform-specific mappings that highlight limitations in existing security tooling.

We synthesize 23 articles on RAG applications in healthcare and systematically analyze privacy challenges through a pipeline-structured framework encompassing data storage, transmission, retrieval and generation stages, delineating potential failure modes, their underlying causes in threat models and system mechanisms, and their practical implications. Building on this analysis, we critically review 17 articles on privacy-preserving strategies for RAG systems.

However, training such models requires substantial computational resources, large curated datasets, and sophisticated alignment procedures. As a result, they constitute highly valuable intellectual property (IP) assets that warrant robust protection mechanisms. Existing IP protection approaches suffer from critical limitations. Model fingerprinting techniques can identify model architectures but fail to establish ownership of specific model instances. In contrast, traditional backdoor-based watermarking methods embed behavioral anomalies that can be easily removed through common post-processing operations such as fine-tuning or knowledge distillation.\n  We propose SEAL, a subspace-anchored watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit signatures directly into the model's latent representational space, supporting both white-box and black-box verification scenarios. Our approach leverages model editing techniques to align the hidden representations of selected anchor samples with predefined orthogonal bit vectors. This alignment embeds the watermark while preserving the model's original factual predictions, rendering the watermark functionally harmless and stealthy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and six prominent LLMs, comparing SEAL with 11 existing fingerprinting and watermarking methods to demonstrate its superior effectiveness, fidelity, efficiency, and robustness. Furthermore, we evaluate SEAL under potential knowledgeable attacks and show that it maintains strong verification performance even when adversaries possess knowledge of the watermarking mechanism and the embedded signatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEAL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u7b7e\u540d\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4LLM\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709IP\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u7eb9\u6280\u672f\u53ea\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u8ba4\u6240\u6709\u6743\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u540e\u95e8\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7b49\u540e\u5904\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u79fb\u9664\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u9009\u5b9a\u951a\u70b9\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6bd4\u7279\u5411\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u59cb\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c6\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSEAL\u76f8\u6bd411\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u77e5\u6653\u6c34\u5370\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SEAL\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u65e0\u5bb3\u4e14\u9690\u853d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u951a\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u540e\u5904\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the field lacks a consolidated understanding of its security properties, adversarial resilience, and methodological consistency. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines CSI-based biometric authentication through a security perspective, analyzing how existing work differs across sensing infrastructure, signal representations, feature pipelines, learning models, and evaluation methodologies. Our synthesis reveals systemic inconsistencies: reliance on aggregate accuracy metrics, limited reporting of FAR/FRR/EER, absence of per-user risk analysis, and scarce consideration of threat models or adversarial feasibility. We construct a unified evaluation framework to empirically expose these issues and demonstrate how security-relevant metrics, such as per-class EER, FCS, and the Gini Coefficient, uncover risk concentration that remains hidden under traditional reporting practices. Our analysis highlights concrete attack surfaces and shows how methodological choices materially influence vulnerability profiles, which include replay, geometric mimicry, and environmental perturbation. Based on these findings, we articulate the security boundaries of current CSI biometrics and provide guidelines for rigorous evaluation, reproducible experimentation, and future research directions.

Traditional countermeasures, including protocol-level modifications and machine learning classifiers, can achieve high accuracy against known threats, yet they fail when confronted with novel or zero-day attacks unless fully retrained, an approach that is impractical for dynamic IoT environments. In this paper, we investigate incremental learning as a practical and adaptive strategy for intrusion detection in RPL-based networks. We systematically evaluate five model families, including ensemble models and deep learning models. Our analysis highlights that incremental learning not only restores detection performance on new attack classes but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously learned threats, all while reducing training time compared to full retraining. By combining five diverse models with attack-specific analysis, forgetting behavior, and time efficiency, this study provides systematic evidence that incremental learning offers a scalable pathway to maintain resilient intrusion detection in evolving RPL-based IoT networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728RPL\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "RPL\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684IoT\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8def\u7531\u5c42\u653b\u51fb\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u578b\u6216\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u52a8\u6001IoT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9057\u5fd8\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u5bf9\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u5df2\u5b66\u4e60\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3aRPL\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, first, we rigorously study the short-term revenue change per hashpower of the adversarial and honest miners for these incentive attacks. To study the long-term effects, we introduce a new efficiency metric defined as the revenue/cost per hashpower per time for the attacker and the honest miners.\n  Our results indicate that the short-term benefits of intermittent mining strategies are negligible compared to the original selfish mining attack, and in the long-term, selfish mining provides better efficiency. We further demonstrate that a coin hopping strategy between BTC and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) relying on BTC DAA benefits the loyal honest miners of BTC in the same way and to the same extent per unit of computational power as it does the hopper in the short-term. For the long-term, we establish a new boundary between the selfish mining and coin hopping attack, identifying the optimal efficient strategy for each parameter.\n  For block withholding strategies, it turns out, the honest miners outside the pool profit from the attack, usually even more than the attacker both in the short-term and the long-term. Moreover, a power adjusting withholding attacker does not necessarily observe a profit lag in the short-term. It has been long thought that the profit lag of selfish mining is among the main reasons why such an attack has not been observed in practice.

Either a single (central) authority verifies all the attributes, or multiple independent authorities verify the attributes distributedly. In the central setup, the authority verifies all user attributes, and the user downloads only the authorized record. While this is communication efficient, it reveals all user attributes to the authority. A distributed setup prevents this privacy breach by letting each authority verify and learn only one attribute. Motivated by this, Jafarpisheh~et~al. introduced an information-theoretic formulation, called distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC). With $N$ non-colluding authorities (servers), $N$ attributes and $K$ possible values for each attribute, the DAPAC system lets each server learn only the single attribute value that it verifies, and is oblivious to the remaining $N-1$. The user retrieves its designated record, without learning anything about the remaining database records. The goal is to maximize the rate, i.e., the ratio of desired message size to total download size. However, not all attributes are sensitive, and DAPAC's privacy constraints can be too restrictive, negatively affecting the rate. To leverage the heterogeneous privacy requirements of user attributes, we propose heterogeneous (Het)DAPAC, a framework which off-loads verification of $N-D$ of the $N$ attributes to a central server, and retains DAPAC's architecture for the $D$ sensitive attributes. We first present a HetDAPAC scheme, which improves the rate from $\\frac{1}{2K}$ to $\\frac{1}{K+1}$, while sacrificing the privacy of a few non-sensitive attributes. Unlike DAPAC, our scheme entails a download imbalance across servers; we propose a second scheme achieving a balanced per-server download and a rate of $\\frac{D+1}{2KD}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HetDAPAC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u975e\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4ece1/2K\u63d0\u5347\u52301/(K+1)\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0b\u8f7d\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5c5e\u6027\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236(DAPAC)\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u90fd\u662f\u654f\u611f\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u654f\u611f\u548c\u975e\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHetDAPAC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06N\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u4e2d\u7684N-D\u4e2a\u975e\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u592e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9D\u4e2a\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u6301DAPAC\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u63d0\u9ad8\u901f\u7387\u4f46\u4e0b\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b9\u6848\u5c06\u901f\u7387\u4ece1/2K\u63d0\u5347\u52301/(K+1)\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230(D+1)/(2KD)\u7684\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HetDAPAC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c5e\u6027\u9690\u79c1\u9700\u6c42\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Arcolezi"], "title": "Private Frequency Estimation Via Residue Number Systems", "comment": "AAAI 2026", "summary": "We present \\textsf{ModularSubsetSelection} (MSS), a new algorithm for locally differentially private (LDP) frequency estimation. Given a universe of size $k$ and $n$ users, our $\\varepsilon$-LDP mechanism encodes each input via a Residue Number System (RNS) over $\\ell$ pairwise-coprime moduli $m_0, \\ldots, m_{\\ell-1}$, and reports a randomly chosen index $j \\in [\\ell]$ along with the perturbed residue using the statistically optimal \\textsf{SubsetSelection}~(SS) (Wang et al. 2016). This design reduces the user communication cost from $\u0398\\bigl(\u03c9\\log_2(k/\u03c9)\\bigr)$ bits required by standard SS (with $\u03c9\\approx k/(e^\\varepsilon+1)$) down to $\\lceil \\log_2 \\ell \\rceil + \\lceil \\log_2 m_j \\rceil$ bits, where $m_j < k$. Server-side decoding runs in $\u0398(n + r k \\ell)$ time, where $r$ is the number of LSMR (Fong and Saunders 2011) iterations. In practice, with well-conditioned moduli (\\textit{i.e.}, constant $r$ and $\\ell = \u0398(\\log k)$), this becomes $\u0398(n + k \\log k)$. We prove that MSS achieves worst-case MSE within a constant factor of state-of-the-art protocols such as SS and \\textsf{ProjectiveGeometryResponse} (PGR) (Feldman et al. 2022), while avoiding the algebraic prerequisites and dynamic-programming decoder required by PGR. Empirically, MSS matches the estimation accuracy of SS, PGR, and \\textsf{RAPPOR} (Erlingsson, Pihur, and Korolova 2014) across realistic $(k, \\varepsilon)$ settings, while offering faster decoding than PGR and shorter user messages than SS.

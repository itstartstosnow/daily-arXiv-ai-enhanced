Unraveling a Practical Blockchain Voting System", "comment": null, "summary": "Ensuring ballot secrecy is critical for fair and trustworthy electronic\nvoting systems, yet achieving strong secrecy guarantees in decentralized,\nlarge-scale elections remains challenging. This paper proposes the concept of\ncollectively secure voting, in which voters themselves can opt in as secret\nholders to protect ballot secrecy. A practical blockchain-based collectively\nsecure voting system is designed and implemented. Our design strikes a balance\nbetween strong confidentiality guarantees and real-world applicability. The\nproposed system combines threshold cryptography and smart contracts to ensure\nballots remain confidential during voting, while all protocol steps remain\ntransparent and verifiable. Voters can use the system without prior blockchain\nknowledge through an intuitive user interface that hides underlying complexity.\nTo evaluate this approach, a user testing is conducted. Results show a high\nwillingness to act as secret holders, reliable participation in share release,\nand high security confidence in the proposed system. The findings demonstrate\nthat voters can collectively maintain secrecy and that such a practical\ndeployment is feasible."}

Due to the context-dependent nature of attacks, however, current\ndefenses are often ill-calibrated as they cannot reliably differentiate\nmalicious and benign instructions, leading to high false positive rates that\nprevent their real-world adoption. To address this, we present a novel approach\ninspired by the fundamental principle of computer security: data should not\ncontain executable instructions. Instead of sample-level classification, we\npropose a token-level sanitization process, which surgically removes any\ninstructions directed at AI systems from tool outputs, capturing malicious\ninstructions as a byproduct. In contrast to existing safety classifiers, this\napproach is non-blocking, does not require calibration, and is agnostic to the\ncontext of tool outputs. Further, we can train such token-level predictors with\nreadily available instruction-tuning data only, and don't have to rely on\nunrealistic prompt injection examples from challenges or of other synthetic\norigin. In our experiments, we find that this approach generalizes well across\na wide range of attacks and benchmarks like AgentDojo, BIPIA, InjecAgent, ASB\nand SEP, achieving a 7-10x reduction of attack success rate (ASR) (34% to 3% on\nAgentDojo), without impairing agent utility in both benign and malicious\nsettings."}

However, state-of-the-art kernel fuzzers,\nincluding the de facto standard Syzkaller, struggle to generate valid syscall\nsequences that respect implicit Syscall Dependency Relations (SDRs).\nConsequently, many generated seeds either fail kernel validation or cannot\npenetrate deep execution paths, resulting in significant inefficiency.\n  We hypothesize that SDRs can be effectively learned from both historic and\npresent kernel execution data, and that incorporating these learned relations\ninto fuzzing can substantially improve seed validity and diversity. To validate\nthis, we propose an approach that utilizes the N-gram model to mine SDRs from\nthe Dongting dataset-one of the largest Linux kernel execution datasets\navailable-as well as from execution traces collected on the fly during fuzzing.\nThe resulting model is used to continuously augment the Choice Table of\nSyzkaller to improve its seed generation and demonstrably increases the Shannon\nEntropy of the Choice Table throughout fuzzing, reflecting more\nempirically-grounded choices in expanding syscall sequences into valid and\ndiverse seeds. In addition, we introduce a Random Walk strategy that instructs\nSyzkaller to construct seeds in a bidirectional manner to further diversify the\ngenerated seeds.\n  We implement our approach in a prototype, Psyzkaller, built on top of\nSyzkaller. Experiments on three representative Linux kernel versions show that\nPsyzkaller improves Syzkaller's code coverage by 4.6%-7.0% in 48-hour fuzzing,\nwhile triggering 110.4%-187.2% more crashes.

In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers\ncan manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the\ntraining dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the\nVLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes\npredefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers.\nSpecifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO\nthat incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions.\nIn addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim\nVLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and\nsuccess to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to\nsuccessfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the\nphysical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on\nclean inputs.

Although labeled as\na hybrid kernel, it is found to generally operate in a monolithic manner by\ndefining a single privileged trust zone in which all system functionality\nresides. This has security implications, as a kernel compromise has immediate\nand significant effects on the entire system. Over the past few years, Apple\nhas taken steps towards a more compartmentalized kernel architecture and a more\nmicrokernel-like design. To date, there has been no scientific discussion of\nSPTM and related security mechanisms. Therefore, the understanding of the\nsystem and the underlying security mechanisms is minimal. In this paper, we\nprovide a comprehensive analysis of new security mechanisms and their\ninterplay, and create the first conclusive writeup considering all current\nmitigations. SPTM acts as the sole authority regarding memory retyping. Our\nanalysis reveals that, through SPTM domains based on frame retyping and memory\nmapping rule sets, SPTM introduces domains of trust into the system,\neffectively gapping different functionalities from one another. Gapped\nfunctionality includes the TXM, responsible for code signing and entitlement\nverification. We further demonstrate how this introduction lays the groundwork\nfor the most recent security feature of Exclaves, and conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of its communication mechanisms. We discover multifold ways of\ncommunication, most notably xnuproxy as a secure world request handler, and the\nTightbeam IPC framework.

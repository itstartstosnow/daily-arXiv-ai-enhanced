In this work, we show that\nadversaries can easily poison the data collection pipeline to embed\nhard-to-detect backdoors that are triggerred by specific target phrases, such\nthat when the agent encounters these triggers, it performs an unsafe or\nmalicious action. We formalize and validate three realistic threat models\ntargeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of\nfine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces;\n2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into\nwebpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply\nchain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data\nto improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few\nas 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an\nagent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a\nspecific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat\nmodels.

As a result, security\nvulnerabilities are hard to identify and mitigate before they start being\nactively exploited by attackers. For this reason, governments have recently\nintroduced cybersecurity regulations that require vendors to share a software\nbill of material (SBOM) with end users or regulators. An SBOM can be employed\nto identify the security vulnerabilities of a software component even without\naccess to its source code, as long as it is accurate and interoperable across\ndifferent tools. This work evaluates this issue through a comprehensive study\nof tools for SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning, including both\nopen-source software and cloud services from major providers. We specifically\ntarget software containers and focus on operating system packages in Linux\ndistributions that are widely used as base images due to their far-reaching\nsecurity impact. Our findings show that the considered tools are largely\nincompatible, leading to inaccurate reporting and a large amount of undetected\nvulnerabilities. We uncover the SBOM confusion vulnerability, a byproduct of\nsuch fragmented ecosystem, where inconsistent formats prevent reliable\nvulnerability detection across tools."}

This paper makes\ntwo points: Firstly, the Five Safes can be understood as a specialization of a\nbroader concept $\\unicode{x2013}$ contextual integrity $\\unicode{x2013}$ to the\nsituation of statistical dissemination by an NSO. We demonstrate this by\nmapping the five parameters of contextual integrity onto the five dimensions of\nthe Five Safes. Secondly, the Five Safes contextualizes narrow, technical\nnotions of privacy within a holistic risk assessment. We demonstrate this with\nthe example of differential privacy (DP). This contextualization allows NSOs to\nplace DP within their Five Safes toolkit while also guiding the design of DP\nimplementations within the broader privacy context, as delineated by both their\nregulation and the relevant social norms."}

Existing\npermissioned DeFi solutions often fail to adequately protect private attributes\nof dApp users and introduce implicit trust assumptions, undermining the\nblockchain's decentralization. Addressing these limitations, this paper\npresents a novel synthesis of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Zero-Knowledge\nProofs (ZKPs), and Attribute-Based Access Control to enable privacy-preserving\non-chain permissioning based on decentralized policy decisions. We provide a\ncomprehensive framework for permissioned dApps that aligns decentralized trust,\nprivacy, and transparency, harmonizing blockchain principles with regulatory\ncompliance. Our framework supports multiple proof types (equality, range,\nmembership, and time-dependent) with efficient proof generation through a\ncommit-and-prove scheme that moves credential authenticity verification outside\nthe ZKP circuit. Experimental evaluation of our KYC-compliant DeFi\nimplementation shows considerable performance improvement for different proof\ntypes compared to baseline approaches. We advance the state-of-the-art through\na holistic approach, flexible proof mechanisms addressing diverse real-world\nrequirements, and optimized proof generation enabling practical deployment."}

However, developing a one-size-fits-all\nIntrusion Detection System (IDS) is challenging because each vehicle has unique\ndata profiles. This is due to the complex and dynamic nature of the data\ngenerated by vehicles regarding their model, driving style, test environment,\nand firmware update. To address this issue, a universal IDS has been developed\nthat can be applied to all types of vehicles without the need for\ncustomization. Unlike conventional IDSs, the universal IDS can adapt to\nevolving data security issues resulting from firmware updates. In this study, a\nnew hybrid approach has been developed, combining Pearson correlation with deep\nlearning techniques. This approach has been tested using data obtained from\nfour distinct mechanical and electronic vehicles, including Tesla, Sonata, and\ntwo Kia models. The data has been combined into two frequency datasets, and\nwavelet transformation has been employed to convert them into the frequency\ndomain, enhancing generalizability. Additionally, a statistical method based on\nindependent rule-based systems using Pearson correlation has been utilized to\nimprove system performance. The system has been compared with eight different\nIDSs, three of which utilize the universal approach, while the remaining five\nare based on conventional techniques. The accuracy of each system has been\nevaluated through benchmarking, and the results demonstrate that the hybrid\nsystem effectively detects intrusions in various vehicle models."}

Existing delegation mechanisms often\nreinforce visibility biases, where a small set of highly ranked delegates\naccumulate disproportionate influence regardless of their alignment with the\nbroader community. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of delegation\nin DAO governance, combining on-chain data from five major protocols with\noff-chain discussions from 14 DAO forums. We develop a methodology to link\nforum participants to on-chain addresses, extract governance interests using\nlarge language models, and compare these interests against delegates'\nhistorical behavior. Our analysis reveals that delegations are frequently\nmisaligned with token holders' expressed priorities and that current\nranking-based interfaces exacerbate power concentration. We argue that\nincorporating interest alignment into delegation processes could mitigate these\nimbalances and improve the representativeness of DAO decision-making."}

Existing machine\nlearning-based detection methods often rely on supervised learning with labeled\ndata, which not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also limits\nadaptability to novel attack patterns. To address these challenges, we propose\nPhishSSL, a self-supervised contrastive learning framework that eliminates the\nneed for labeled phishing data during training. PhishSSL combines hybrid\ntabular augmentation with adaptive feature attention to produce semantically\nconsistent views and emphasize discriminative attributes. We evaluate PhishSSL\non three phishing datasets with distinct feature compositions. Across all\ndatasets, PhishSSL consistently outperforms unsupervised and self-supervised\nbaselines, while ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component.\nMoreover, PhishSSL maintains robust performance despite the diversity of\nfeature sets, highlighting its strong generalization and transferability. These\nresults demonstrate that PhishSSL offers a promising solution for phishing\nwebsite detection, particularly effective against evolving threats in dynamic\nWeb environments."}

However, the provenance of\nprocess adaptations, especially modifications during execu- tion, remains\ninsufficiently addressed. A review of the literature reveals a lack of\nsystematic approaches for capturing provenance information about adaptive\nworkflows/processes. To fill this gap, we propose the AdProv method for\ncollecting, storing, retrieving, and visualizing prove- nance of runtime\nworkflow adaptations. In addition to the definition of the AdProv method in\nterms of steps and concepts like change events, we also present an architecture\nfor a Provenance Holder service that is essential for implementing the method.\nTo ensure semantic consistency and interoperability we define a mapping to the\nontology PROV Ontol- ogy (PROV-O). Additionally, we extend the XES standard\nwith elements for adaptation logging.

In this paper, we propose\na privacy-preserving protocol which tackles structure generation and parameter\nlearning of SPNs. Additionally, we provide a protocol for private inference on\nSPNs, subsequent to training. To preserve the privacy of the participants, we\nderive our protocol based on secret sharing, which guarantees privacy in the\nhonest-but-curious setting even when at most half of the parties cooperate to\ndisclose the data. The protocol makes use of a forest of randomly generated\nSPNs, which is trained and weighted privately and can then be used for private\ninference on data points. Our experiments indicate that preserving the privacy\nof all participants does not decrease log-likelihood performance on both\nhomogeneously and heterogeneously partitioned data. We furthermore show that\nour protocol's performance is comparable to current state-of-the-art SPN\nlearners in homogeneously partitioned data settings. In terms of runtime and\nmemory usage, we demonstrate that our implementation scales well when\nincreasing the number of parties, comparing favorably to protocols for neural\nnetworks, when they are trained to reproduce the input-output behavior of SPNs."}

Accepted to the conference Human Computer Interaction International", "summary": "Large Language Models are expanding beyond being a tool humans use and into independent agents that can observe an environment, reason about solutions to problems, make changes that impact those environments, and understand how their actions impacted their environment. One of the most common applications of these LLM Agents is in computer programming, where agents can successfully work alongside humans to generate code while controlling programming environments or networking systems. However, with the increasing ability and complexity of these agents comes dangers about the potential for their misuse. A concerning application of LLM agents is in the domain cybersecurity, where they have the potential to greatly expand the threat imposed by attacks such as social engineering. This is due to the fact that LLM Agents can work autonomously and perform many tasks that would normally require time and effort from skilled human programmers. While this threat is concerning, little attention has been given to assessments of the capabilities of LLM coding agents in generating code for social engineering attacks. In this work we compare different LLMs in their ability and willingness to produce potentially dangerous code bases that could be misused by cyberattackers. The result is a dataset of 200 website code bases and logs from 40 different LLM coding agents. Analysis of models shows which metrics of LLMs are more and less correlated with performance in generating spear-phishing sites. Our analysis and the dataset we present will be of interest to researchers and practitioners concerned in defending against the potential misuse of LLMs in spear-phishing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u793e\u4ea4\u5de5\u7a0b\u653b\u51fb\u4ee3\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86200\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u548c40\u4e2aLLM\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u9c7c\u53c9\u5f0f\u9493\u9c7c\u7f51\u7ad9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7f16\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6ee5\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u793e\u4ea4\u5de5\u7a0b\u653b\u51fb\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9LLM\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u6b64\u7c7b\u5371\u9669\u4ee3\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u9669\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e86200\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u548c40\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLM\u5404\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u9c7c\u53c9\u5f0f\u9493\u9c7c\u7f51\u7ad9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b200\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u548c40\u4e2aLLM\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9bLLM\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u9c7c\u53c9\u5f0f\u9493\u9c7c\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9632\u5fa1LLM\u5728\u9c7c\u53c9\u5f0f\u9493\u9c7c\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6ee5\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u751f\u6210\u793e\u4ea4\u5de5\u7a0b\u653b\u51fb\u4ee3\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u6ee5\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9632\u5fa1LLM\u5728\u9c7c\u53c9\u5f0f\u9493\u9c7c\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u6ee5\u7528\u3002"}}

This creates a gap between what agents can do and should do. This gap widens as agents engage in multi-turn interactions and employ diverse tools, introducing new risks overlooked by existing benchmarks. To systematically scale safety testing into multi-turn, tool-realistic settings, we propose a principled taxonomy that transforms single-turn harmful tasks into multi-turn attack sequences. Using this taxonomy, we construct MT-AgentRisk (Multi-Turn Agent Risk Benchmark), the first benchmark to evaluate multi-turn tool-using agent safety. Our experiments reveal substantial safety degradation: the Attack Success Rate (ASR) increases by 16% on average across open and closed models in multi-turn settings. To close this gap, we propose ToolShield, a training-free, tool-agnostic, self-exploration defense: when encountering a new tool, the agent autonomously generates test cases, executes them to observe downstream effects, and distills safety experiences for deployment. Experiments show that ToolShield effectively reduces ASR by 30% on average in multi-turn interactions.

Prior work on backdoor attacks has largely focused on a black-box threat model, with an adversary targeting the model builder's LLM. However, in the bias manipulation setting, the model builder themselves could be the adversary, warranting a white-box threat model where the attacker's ability to poison, and manipulate the poisoned data is substantially increased. Furthermore, despite growing research in semantically-triggered backdoors, most studies have limited themselves to syntactically-triggered attacks. Motivated by these limitations, we conduct an analysis consisting of over 1000 evaluations using higher poisoning ratios and greater data augmentation to gain a better understanding of the potential of syntactically- and semantically-triggered backdoor attacks in a white-box setting. In addition, we study whether two representative defense paradigms, model-intrinsic and model-extrinsic backdoor removal, are able to mitigate these attacks. Our analysis reveals numerous new findings. We discover that while both syntactically- and semantically-triggered attacks can effectively induce the target behaviour, and largely preserve utility, semantically-triggered attacks are generally more effective in inducing negative biases, while both backdoor types struggle with causing positive biases. Furthermore, while both defense types are able to mitigate these backdoors, they either result in a substantial drop in utility, or require high computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u767d\u76d2\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8bed\u6cd5\u89e6\u53d1\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8d1f\u9762\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u4e24\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7528\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u89e6\u53d1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u64cd\u7eb5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u653b\u51fb\u8005\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u767d\u76d2\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u8fc71000\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5728\u767d\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u6cd5\u89e6\u53d1\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5916\u5728\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u79fb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u6cd5\u89e6\u53d1\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u653b\u51fb\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8d1f\u9762\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u5728\u5f15\u53d1\u6b63\u9762\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u540e\u95e8\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u4e48\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7528\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u767d\u76d2\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8d1f\u9762\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This new issuance paradigm has led to a surge in high-risk token launches, causing substantial financial losses for unsuspecting buyers. In this paper, we introduce MemeTrans, the first dataset for studying and detecting high-risk memecoin launches on Solana. MemeTrans covers over 40k memecoin launches that successfully migrated to the public Decentralized Exchange (DEX), with over 30 million transactions during the initial sale on launchpad and 180 million transactions after migration. To precisely capture launch patterns, we design 122 features spanning dimensions such as context, trading activity, holding concentration, and time-series dynamics, supplemented with bundle-level data that reveals multiple accounts controlled by the same entity. Finally, we introduce an annotation approach to label the risk level of memecoin launches, which combines statistical indicators with a manipulation-pattern detector. Experiments on the introduced high-risk launch detection task suggest that designed features are informative for capturing high-risk patterns and ML models trained on MemeTrans can effectively reduce financial loss by 56.1%.

With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), federated fine-tuning of generative LLMs has gained attention as a way to leverage distributed data while preserving confidentiality. However, this setting introduces fundamental challenges: (i) privacy leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) due to LLM memorization, and (ii) a persistent tension between global generalization and local utility under heterogeneous data. Existing defenses, such as data sanitization and differential privacy, reduce leakage but often degrade downstream performance. We propose SecureGate, a privacy-aware federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs that provides fine-grained privacy control without sacrificing utility. SecureGate employs a dual-adapter LoRA architecture: a secure adapter that learns sanitized, globally shareable representations, and a revealing adapter that captures sensitive, organization-specific knowledge. A token-controlled gating module selectively activates these adapters at inference time, enabling controlled information disclosure without retraining. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world datasets show that SecureGate improves task utility while substantially reducing PII leakage, achieving up to a 31.66X reduction in inference attack accuracy and a 17.07X reduction in extraction recall for unauthorized requests. Additionally, it maintains 100% routing reliability to the correct adapter and incurs only minimal computational and communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "SecureGate\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9002\u914d\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u63a7\u5236\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09LLM\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff1b2\uff09\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5168\u5c40\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff09\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSecureGate\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u9002\u914d\u5668LoRA\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5b89\u5168\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6e05\u6d17\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6355\u83b7\u654f\u611f\u7684\u673a\u6784\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724c\u63a7\u5236\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSecureGate\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11PII\u6cc4\u9732\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e31.66\u500d\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u964d\u4f4e17.07\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u8def\u7531\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8fbe100%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "SecureGate\u4e3aLLM\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9690\u79c1\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Although the dataset watermark technique holds promise for auditing and verifying usage, existing methods are hindered by inconsistent evaluations, which impede fair comparisons and assessments of real-world viability. To address this gap, we propose a two-layer taxonomy that categorizes methods by implementation (model-based vs. model-free injection; model-behavior vs. model-message verification), offering a structured framework for cross-task analysis. Then, we develop DWBench, a unified benchmark and open-source toolkit for systematically evaluating image dataset watermark techniques in classification and generation tasks.\n  Using DWBench, we assess 25 representative methods under standardized conditions, perturbation-based robustness tests, multi-watermark coexistence, and multi-user interference. In addition to reporting the results of four commonly used metrics, we present the results of two new metrics: sample significance for fine-grained watermark distinguishability and verification success rate for dataset-level auditing, which enable accurate and reproducible benchmarking. Key findings reveal inherent trade-offs: no single method dominates all scenarios; classification and generation tasks require specialized approaches; and existing techniques exhibit instability at low watermark rates and in realistic multi-user settings, with elevated false positives or performance declines.

We present AISA, a lightweight, single-pass defense that activates safety behaviors already latent inside the model rather than treating safety as an add-on. AISA first localizes intrinsic safety awareness via spatiotemporal analysis and shows that intent-discriminative signals are broadly encoded, with especially strong separability appearing in the scaled dot-product outputs of specific attention heads near the final structural tokens before generation. Using a compact set of automatically selected heads, AISA extracts an interpretable prompt-risk score with minimal overhead, achieving detector-level performance competitive with strong proprietary baselines on small (7B) models. AISA then performs logits-level steering: it modulates the decoding distribution in proportion to the inferred risk, ranging from normal generation for benign prompts to calibrated refusal for high-risk requests -- without changing model parameters, adding auxiliary modules, or requiring multi-pass inference. Extensive experiments spanning 13 datasets, 12 LLMs, and 14 baselines demonstrate that AISA improves robustness and transfer while preserving utility and reducing false refusals, enabling safer deployment even for weakly aligned or intentionally risky model variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "AISA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5355\u6b21\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4f4dLLM\u5185\u90e8\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u8fdb\u884clogits\u7ea7\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u5373\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u91cd\u5199\u3001\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u62a4\u680f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u6709\u7528\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u6790\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5185\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u610f\u56fe\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u6784token\u524d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u70b9\u79ef\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u5934\u90e8\u96c6\u5408\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6570\uff1b3. \u8fdb\u884clogits\u7ea7\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u89e3\u7801\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u6b63\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u5230\u6821\u51c6\u62d2\u7edd\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u300112\u4e2aLLM\u548c14\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cAISA\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u62d2\u7edd\u3002\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\uff087B\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5927\u4e13\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AISA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u6dfb\u52a0\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u5757\u6216\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f31\u5bf9\u9f50\u6216\u6545\u610f\u5192\u9669\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u4e5f\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

For safety alignment, the core challenge lies in the inherent trade-off between safety and utility. However, prevailing alignment strategies typically construct CoT training data with explicit safety rules via context distillation. This approach inadvertently limits reasoning capabilities by creating a rigid association between rule memorization and refusal. To mitigate the safety-utility trade-off, we propose the Adaptive Safe Context Learning (ASCL) framework to improve the reasoning given proper context. ASCL formulates safety alignment as a multi-turn tool-use process, empowering the model to autonomously decide when to consult safety rules and how to generate the ongoing reasoning. Furthermore, to counteract the preference for rule consultation during RL, we introduce Inverse Frequency Policy Optimization (IFPO) to rebalance advantage estimates. By decoupling rule retrieval and subsequent reasoning, our method achieves higher overall performance compared to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faASCL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u89c4\u5219\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u9762\u4e34\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6743\u8861\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u84b8\u998f\u6784\u5efa\u660e\u786e\u7684CoT\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c4\u5219\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u62d2\u7edd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u50f5\u5316\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ASCL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u54a8\u8be2\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5219\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u751f\u6210\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u9006\u9891\u7387\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08IFPO\uff09\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u5e73\u8861\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u89c4\u5219\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "ASCL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u54a8\u8be2\u673a\u5236\u548cIFPO\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b"}}

We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift (RIPD). Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation, they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judge's preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks, in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5% (helpfulness) and 27.9% (harmlessness). When these judgments are used to generate preference labels for downstream post-training, the induced bias propagates through alignment pipelines and becomes internalized in trained policies. This leads to persistent and systematic drift in model behavior. Overall, our findings highlight evaluation rubrics as a sensitive and manipulable control interface, revealing a system-level alignment risk that extends beyond evaluator reliability alone.

Current cybersecurity lacks fundamental infrastructure including standardized population definitions, reliable outcome measurements, understanding of transmission mechanisms, and coordinated intervention testing. Drawing on public health's transformation from fragmented local responses to coordinated evidence-based discipline, we propose a national Cyber Public Health System for systematic data collection, standardized measurement, and coordinated response.

Given the sensitivity of the information it reveals, location access is protected by mobile operating systems and users have control over which applications can access it. We argue that applications can still infer the coarse-grain location information by using alternative sensors that are available in off-the-shelf mobile devices that do not require any permissions from the users. In this paper we present a zero-permission attack based on the use of the in-built magnetometer, considering a variety of methods for identifying location-types from their magnetic signature. We implement the proposed approach by using four different techniques for time-series classification. In order to evaluate the approach, we conduct an in-the-wild study to collect a dataset of nearly 70 hours of magnetometer readings with six different phones at 66 locations, each accompanied by a label that classifies it as belonging to one of six selected categories. Finally, using this dataset, we quantify the performance of all models based on two evaluation criteria: (i) leave-a-place-out (using the test data collected from an unknown place), and (ii) leave-a-device-out (using the test data collected from an unknown device) showing that we are able to achieve 40.5% and 39.5% accuracy in classifying the location-type for each evaluation criteria respectively against a random baseline of approximately 16.7% for both of them.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u673a\u5185\u7f6e\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6743\u9650\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7c7b\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7528\u6237\u6388\u6743\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u53d7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u9700\u6743\u9650\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u5982\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\uff09\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u8bfb\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6536\u96c66\u90e8\u624b\u673a\u572866\u4e2a\u5730\u70b9\u8fd170\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a6\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b", "result": "\u5728\u7559\u51fa\u5730\u70b9\u548c\u7559\u51fa\u8bbe\u5907\u4e24\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523040.5%\u548c39.5%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e16.7%\u7684\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf", "conclusion": "\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u96f6\u6743\u9650\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u65b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6743\u9650\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236"}}

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the post-training pipeline for LLM-based VD, spanning from cold-start SFT to off-policy preference optimization and on-policy RL, uncovering how data curation, stage interactions, reward mechanisms, and evaluation protocols collectively dictate the efficacy of model training and assessment. Our study identifies practical guidelines and insights: (1) SFT based on rejection sampling greatly outperforms rationalization-based supervision, which can introduce hallucinations due to ground-truth leakage. (2) While increased SFT epochs constantly benefit preference optimization, excessive SFT inhibits self-exploration during RL, ultimately limiting performance gains. (3) Coarse-grained reward signals often mislead RL, whereas fine-grained root-cause judgments ensure reliable credit assignment. Specification-based rewards offer further benefits but incur significant effort in specification generation. (4) Although filtering extremely hard-to-detect vulnerability samples improves RL training efficiency, the cost of performance loss should be considered in practical applications. (5) Models trained under GRPO significantly outperform those using SFT and preference optimization (i.e., DPO and ORPO), as well as a series of zero-shot SOTA LLMs, underscoring the significant potential of on-policy RL for LLM-based VD. (6) In contrast to binary matching that tends to overestimate performance, LLM-as-a-Judge based on root-cause analysis provides a more robust evaluation protocol, although its accuracy varies across judge models with different levels of security expertise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLM\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u7684SFT\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u76d1\u7763\uff0cGRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSFT\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u7684LLM-as-a-Judge\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bd4\u4e8c\u5143\u5339\u914d\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901a\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76LLM\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u51b7\u542f\u52a8SFT\u5230\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u540c\u7b56\u7565RL\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u3001\u9636\u6bb5\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u9762\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b2\uff09\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\u548cORPO\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08GRPO\uff09\uff1b4\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6vs\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6839\u56e0\u5224\u65ad\uff09\uff1b5\uff09\u6837\u672c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b56\u7565\uff1b6\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u7684LLM-as-a-Judge\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u7684SFT\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u76d1\u7763\uff1b2\uff09\u8fc7\u591aSFT\u4f1a\u6291\u5236RL\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b3\uff09\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6839\u56e0\u5224\u65ad\u5956\u52b1\u6bd4\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff1b4\uff09\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6781\u96be\u68c0\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4f46\u9700\u6743\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff1b5\uff09GRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSFT\u3001DPO\u3001ORPO\u548c\u96f6-shot SOTA LLMs\uff1b6\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u7684LLM-as-a-Judge\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bd4\u4e8c\u5143\u5339\u914d\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aLLM\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u548c\u6df1\u523b\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u540c\u7b56\u7565RL\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u3001\u9636\u6bb5\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Multi-bit watermarking can embed identifiers into generated text, but existing methods struggle to keep both text quality and watermark strength while carrying long messages. We propose MC$^2$Mark, a distortion-free multi-bit watermarking framework designed for reliable embedding and decoding of long messages. Our key technical idea is Multi-Channel Colored Reweighting, which encodes bits through structured token reweighting while keeping the token distribution unbiased, together with Multi-Layer Sequential Reweighting to strengthen the watermark signal and an evidence-accumulation detector for message recovery. Experiments show that MC$^2$Mark improves detectability and robustness over prior multi-bit watermarking methods while preserving generation quality, achieving near-perfect accuracy for short messages and exceeding the second-best method by nearly 30% for long messages.", "AI": {"tldr": "MC\u00b2Mark\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u5931\u771f\u7684\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u901a\u9053\u7740\u8272\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5199\u4f5c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u8ffd\u6eaf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6c34\u5370\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u627f\u8f7d\u957f\u6d88\u606f\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMC\u00b2Mark\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u591a\u901a\u9053\u7740\u8272\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u7f16\u7801\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u504f\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u987a\u5e8f\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u589e\u5f3a\u6c34\u5370\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bc1\u636e\u7d2f\u79ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u606f\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMC\u00b2Mark\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u77ed\u6d88\u606f\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u957f\u6d88\u606f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd130%\u3002", "conclusion": "MC\u00b2Mark\u4e3a\u957f\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u6c34\u5370\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u5931\u771f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6c34\u5370\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6d88\u606f\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, rigorous justification for why side-channel leakage is inevitable in encrypted communications has been lacking. This paper establishes a strict foundation from information theory by constructing a formal model \\(\u03a3=(\u0393,\u03a9)\\), where \\(\u0393=(A,\u03a0,\u03a6,N)\\) describes the causal chain of application generation, protocol encapsulation, encryption transformation, and network transmission, while \\(\u03a9\\) characterizes observation capabilities. Based on composite channel structure, data processing inequality, and Lipschitz statistics propagation, we propose and prove the Side-Channel Existence Theorem: for distinguishable semantic pairs, under conditions including mapping non-degeneracy (\\(\\mathbb{E}[d(z_P,z_N)\\mid X]\\le C\\)), protocol-layer distinguishability (expectation difference \\(\\ge\\bar\u0394\\)), Lipschitz continuity, observation non-degeneracy (\\(\u03c1>0\\)), and propagation condition (\\(C<\\bar\u0394/2L_\\varphi\\)), the mutual information \\(I(X;Y)\\) is strictly positive with explicit lower bound. The corollary shows that in efficiency-prioritized systems, leakage is inevitable when at least one application pair is distinguishable.

Until recently, the implementation of security measures in DevOps environments was often considered optional by many government entities and critical national services operating in the cloud. This includes systems managing sensitive information, such as electoral processes or military operations, which have historically been valuable targets for cybercriminals. Resistance to security implementation is often driven by concerns over losing agility in software development, increasing the risk of accumulated vulnerabilities. Nowadays, patching software is no longer enough; adopting a proactive cyber defense strategy, supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI), is crucial to anticipating and mitigating threats. Thus, this work proposes integrating the Security Chaos Engineering (SCE) methodology with a new LLM-based flow to automate the creation of attack defense trees that represent adversary behavior and facilitate the construction of SCE experiments based on these graphical models, enabling teams to stay one step ahead of attackers and implement previously unconsidered defenses.

This abstraction introduces an under-measured attack surface: skill-based prompt injection, where poisoned skills can steer agents away from user intent and safety policies. In practice, naive injections often fail because the malicious intent is too explicit or drifts too far from the original skill, leading agents to ignore or refuse them; existing attacks are also largely hand-crafted. We propose the first automated framework for stealthy prompt injection tailored to agent skills. The framework forms a closed loop with three agents: an Attack Agent that synthesizes injection skills under explicit stealth constraints, a Code Agent that executes tasks using the injected skills in a realistic tool environment, and an Evaluate Agent that logs action traces (e.g., tool calls and file operations) and verifies whether targeted malicious behaviors occurred. We also propose a malicious payload hiding strategy that conceals adversarial operations in auxiliary scripts while injecting optimized inducement prompts to trigger tool execution. Extensive experiments across diverse coding-agent settings and real-world software engineering tasks show that our method consistently achieves high attack success rates under realistic settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9690\u853d\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u653b\u51fb", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6280\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u591a\u4e3a\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u5f0f\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u62d2\u7edd", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1a\u653b\u51fb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u9690\u853d\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5408\u6210\u6ce8\u5165\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u5177\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5f55\u884c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6076\u610f\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9690\u85cf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u64cd\u4f5c\u9690\u85cf\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u811a\u672c\u4e2d", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6280\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5bf9\u6297\u9690\u853d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb"}}

This openness introduces a security misalignment: agents implicitly trust tools exposed by potentially untrusted MCP servers. However, despite its excellent utility, existing agents typically offer limited validation for third-party MCP servers. As a result, agents remain vulnerable to MCP-based attacks that exploit the misalignment between agents and servers throughout the tool invocation lifecycle. In this paper, we propose MCPShield as a plug-in security cognition layer that mitigates this misalignment and ensures agent security when invoking MCP-based tools. Drawing inspiration from human experience-driven tool validation, MCPShield assists agent forms security cognition with metadata-guided probing before invocation. Our method constrains execution within controlled boundaries while cognizing runtime events, and subsequently updates security cognition by reasoning over historical traces after invocation, building on human post-use reflection on tool behavior. Experiments demonstrate that MCPShield exhibits strong generalization in defending against six novel MCP-based attack scenarios across six widely used agentic LLMs, while avoiding false positives on benign servers and incurring low deployment overhead. Overall, our work provides a practical and robust security safeguard for MCP-based tool invocation in open agent ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MCPShield\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001\u53d7\u63a7\u6267\u884c\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u8ffd\u8e2a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9632\u5fa1\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9MCP\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "MCP\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\uff09\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e86LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9690\u5f0f\u4fe1\u4efb\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684MCP\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9MCP\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230MCP\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "MCPShield\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d2\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\uff0c\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u5177\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff1a1\uff09\u8c03\u7528\u524d\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u6d4b\u5e2e\u52a9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f62\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u77e5\uff1b2\uff09\u8c03\u7528\u65f6\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u8fb9\u754c\u5185\u6267\u884c\u5e76\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b3\uff09\u8c03\u7528\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u8ffd\u8e2a\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u65b0\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\u5bf9\u5de5\u5177\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMCPShield\u5728\u9632\u5fa1\u516d\u79cd\u65b0\u578bMCP\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u516d\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u4e14\u90e8\u7f72\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "MCPShield\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684MCP\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In both respects they have also surpassed vulnerabilities coordinated by European public authorities. Regarding the European authorities, the Spanish public authority has been particularly active.

In this paper, we investigate how reported security vulnerabilities can be assessed in a realistic grey-box exploitation setting that leverages minimal vulnerability metadata, specifically a CWE classification and a vulnerable code location.

Evaluated on the CVE-Bench dataset, AXE achieves a 30% exploitation success rate, a 3x improvement over state-of-the-art black-box baselines. Even in a single-agent configuration, grey-box metadata yields a 1.75x performance gain. Systematic error analysis shows that most failed attempts arise from specific reasoning gaps, including misinterpreted vulnerability semantics and unmet execution preconditions.

However, when the database contains sensitive corpora, such as medical records or legal documents, RAG poses serious privacy risks by potentially exposing private information through its outputs. Prior work has demonstrated that one can practically craft adversarial prompts that force an LLM to regurgitate the augmented contexts. A promising direction is to integrate differential privacy (DP), a privacy notion that offers strong formal guarantees, into RAG systems. However, naively applying DP mechanisms into existing systems often leads to significant utility degradation. Particularly for RAG systems, DP can reduce the usefulness of the augmented contexts leading to increase risk of hallucination from the LLMs. Motivated by these challenges, we present DP-KSA, a novel privacy-preserving RAG algorithm that integrates DP using the propose-test-release paradigm. DP-KSA follows from a key observation that most question-answering (QA) queries can be sufficiently answered with a few keywords. Hence, DP-KSA first obtains an ensemble of relevant contexts, each of which will be used to generate a response from an LLM. We utilize these responses to obtain the most frequent keywords in a differentially private manner. Lastly, the keywords are augmented into the prompt for the final output.

Its application to machine learning (ML) has gained significant attention, particularly for secure inference services deployed across multiple cloud virtual machines (VMs), where each VM acts as an MPC party. Model providers secret-share model weights, and users secret-share inputs, ensuring that each server operates only on random shares. While MPC provides strong cryptographic guarantees, it incurs substantial computational and communication overhead. Deep neural networks rely heavily on convolutional and fully connected layers, which require costly matrix multiplications in MPC. To reduce this cost, we propose leveraging low-rank decomposition (LRD) for linear layers, replacing one large matrix multiplication with two smaller ones. Each matrix multiplication in MPC incurs a round of communication, meaning decomposing one matrix multiplication into two leads to an additional communication round. Second, the added matrix multiplication requires an additional truncation step to maintain numerical precision. Since truncation itself requires communication and computation, these overheads can offset the gains from decomposition. To address this, we introduce two complementary optimizations: truncation skipping and efficient linear layer concatenation. Truncation skipping removes the extra truncation induced by LRD, while linear layer concatenation pipelines operations to hide the additional communication round. Together, these techniques mitigate the main overheads of LRD in MPC and improve overall efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across MPC protocols. Experiments show up to 25% speedup in n-PC and 33% in 3-PC protocols over full-rank baselines, along with up to 52% GPU energy savings and 88% reduction in offline-phase latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u4e0eMPC\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8df3\u8fc7\u622a\u65ad\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u62fc\u63a5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u591a\u65b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b89\u5168\u591a\u65b9\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08MPC\uff09\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u548c\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728MPC\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "1. \u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\uff08LRD\uff09\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c0f\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u622a\u65ad\u8df3\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u6d88\u9664LRD\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u989d\u5916\u622a\u65ad\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u62fc\u63a5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u64cd\u4f5c\u9690\u85cf\u989d\u5916\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6b21\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u5728n-PC\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe25%\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u57283-PC\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b033%\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff1bGPU\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe52%\uff1b\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe88%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u4e13\u95e8\u7684MPC\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In response, the international cybersecurity community has prioritized the implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), a new cryptographic standard designed to resist quantum attacks while operating on classical computers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already standardized several PQC algorithms and plans to deprecate classical asymmetric schemes, such as RSA and ECDSA, by 2035. Despite this urgency, PQC adoption remains slow, often due to limited developer expertise. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are intended to bridge this gap, yet prior research on classical security APIs demonstrates that poor usability of cryptographic APIs can lead developers to introduce vulnerabilities during implementation of the applications, a risk amplified by the novelty and complexity of PQC. To date, the usability of PQC APIs has not been systematically studied. This research presents an empirical evaluation of the usability of the PQC APIs, observing how developers interact with APIs and documentation during software development tasks. The study identifies cognitive factors that influence the developer's performance when working with PQC primitives with minimal onboarding. The findings highlight opportunities across the PQC ecosystem to improve developer-facing guidance, terminology alignment, and workflow examples to better support non-specialists.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u540e\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u7801(PQC)API\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7531\u4e8ePQC\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9bAPI\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u6863\u3001\u672f\u8bed\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u793a\u4f8b\u6765\u652f\u6301\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5a01\u80c1\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u94a5\u5bc6\u7801\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u56fd\u9645\u793e\u4f1a\u5df2\u4f18\u5148\u5b9e\u65bd\u540e\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u7801(PQC)\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1NIST\u5df2\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u591a\u4e2aPQC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u8ba1\u5212\u57282035\u5e74\u524d\u6dd8\u6c70\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46PQC\u91c7\u7528\u8fdb\u5c55\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u9650\u3002\u867d\u7136API\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f46\u5bc6\u7801API\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u5dee\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u800cPQC\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u4e0ePQC API\u548c\u6587\u6863\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5165\u95e8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528PQC\u539f\u8bed\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0PQC API\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9bAPI\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86PQC\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5728PQC\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6539\u8fdb\u9762\u5411\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3001\u672f\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9PQC API\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347PQC\u91c7\u7528\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Flow theory suggests that when job demands misalign with practitioner capabilities, work becomes overwhelming or tedious rather than engaging. Achieving challenge-skill balance begins at hiring: if job descriptions inaccurately portray requirements, organizations risk recruiting underskilled practitioners who face anxiety or overskilled ones who experience boredom. Yet we lack empirical understanding of what current SOC job descriptions actually specify. We analyzed 106 public SOC job postings from November to December 2024 across 35 organizations in 11 countries, covering Analysts (n=17), Incident Responders (n=38), Threat Hunters (n=39), and SOC Managers (n=12). Using Inductive Content Analysis, we coded certifications, technical skills, soft skills, tasks, and experience requirements. Three patterns emerged: (1) Communication skills dominate (50.9% of postings), exceeding SIEM tools (18.9%) or programming (30.2%), suggesting organizations prioritize collaboration over technical capabilities. (2) Certification expectations vary widely: CISSP leads (22.6%), but 43 distinct credentials appear with no universal standard. (3) Technical requirements show consensus: Python dominates programming (27.4%), Splunk leads SIEM platforms (14.2%), and ISO 27001 (13.2%) and NIST (10.4%) are most cited standards. These findings enable organizations to audit job descriptions against empirical baselines, help practitioners identify valued certifications and skills, and allow researchers to validate whether stated requirements align with actual demands. This establishes the foundation for flow-aligned interview protocols and investigation of how AI reshapes requirements.

While closed-source models typically rely on external defenses, open-weight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameter-level manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u586b\u5145\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5148\u524d\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u4f46\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5176\u88ab\u6ee5\u7528\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4e5f\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5185\u90e8\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u9884\u586b\u5145\u529f\u80fd\u5141\u8bb8\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f00\u59cb\u524d\u9884\u8bbe\u521d\u59cb\u54cd\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u9884\u586b\u5145\u653b\u51fb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8620\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u586b\u5145\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u4e3b\u8981\u5f53\u4ee3\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u6301\u7eed\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4e14\u5148\u524d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u867d\u7136\u67d0\u4e9b\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u9884\u586b\u5145\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u9488\u5bf9\u9884\u586b\u5145\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

As EU regulations mandate EUDI Wallet acceptance by 2027, SSI adoption becomes a compliance necessity. However, each SSI Verifier exposes different APIs with distinct request parameters, response formats, and claim structures, requiring custom wrappers and dedicated infrastructure, contrasting with OpenID Connect (OIDC) where standardized protocols enable seamless integration.\n  interID is an ecosystem-agnostic platform unifying credential verification across Hyperledger Aries/Indy, EBSI, and EUDI ecosystems. We extend interID with an OIDC bridge providing Verifier-as-a-Service, enabling SSI verification through standard OIDC flows. Organizations receive ID Tokens with verified credential attributes without implementing Verifier-specific logic or deploying infrastructure. The multi-tenant architecture leverages Keycloak with strict tenant isolation. Key innovations include PKCE support, scope-to-proof-template mappings translating OIDC scopes into ecosystem-specific verification requests, and a security analysis identifying novel attack surfaces at the intersection of OIDC, SSI, and multi-tenant architectures, threats covered by neither RFC 6819 nor existing SSI analyses alone.\n  Our evaluation demonstrates security equivalence to production identity providers through threat modeling identifying 11 attack vectors, including seven beyond RFC 6819's scope. Integration analysis shows organizations can adopt SSI authentication with comparable effort to adding traditional federated providers. By combining familiar OIDC patterns with SaaS deployment, our work lowers integration and operational barriers, enabling regulatory compliance through configuration rather than custom development.", "AI": {"tldr": "interID\u5e73\u53f0\u901a\u8fc7OIDC\u6865\u63a5\u63d0\u4f9bSSI\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5373\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6OIDC\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884cSSI\u51ed\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u903b\u8f91\u6216\u90e8\u7f72\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6b27\u76df\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u57282027\u5e74\u524d\u63a5\u53d7EUDI\u94b1\u5305\uff0cSSI\u91c7\u7528\u6210\u4e3a\u5408\u89c4\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e0d\u540cSSI\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u66b4\u9732\u4e0d\u540c\u7684API\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5305\u88c5\u5668\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0eOpenID Connect\uff08OIDC\uff09\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u534f\u8bae\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55interID\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0OIDC\u6865\u63a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5373\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79df\u6237\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528Keycloak\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u79df\u6237\u9694\u79bb\u3002\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u5305\u62ecPKCE\u652f\u6301\u3001\u8303\u56f4\u5230\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u677f\u6620\u5c04\uff08\u5c06OIDC\u8303\u56f4\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bf7\u6c42\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522bOIDC\u3001SSI\u548c\u591a\u79df\u6237\u67b6\u6784\u4ea4\u53c9\u5904\u7684\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u4ea7\u8eab\u4efd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5a01\u80c1\u5efa\u6a21\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8611\u4e2a\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d7\u4e2a\u8d85\u51faRFC 6819\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u96c6\u6210\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53ef\u4ee5\u91c7\u7528SSI\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u4e0e\u6dfb\u52a0\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u719f\u6089\u7684OIDC\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0eSaaS\u90e8\u7f72\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u914d\u7f6e\u800c\u975e\u5b9a\u5236\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u73b0\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u3002"}}

Code repository: https://github.com/researchaudio/canarybench", "summary": "Aggregate analytics over conversational data are increasingly used for safety monitoring, governance, and product analysis in large language model systems. A common practice is to embed conversations, cluster them, and publish short textual summaries describing each cluster. While raw conversations may never be exposed, these derived summaries can still pose privacy risks if they contain personally identifying information (PII) or uniquely traceable strings copied from individual conversations.\n  We introduce CanaryBench, a simple and reproducible stress test for privacy leakage in cluster-level conversation summaries. CanaryBench generates synthetic conversations with planted secret strings (\"canaries\") that simulate sensitive identifiers. Because canaries are known a priori, any appearance of these strings in published summaries constitutes a measurable leak.\n  Using TF-IDF embeddings and k-means clustering on 3,000 synthetic conversations (24 topics) with a canary injection rate of 0.60, we evaluate an intentionally extractive example snippet summarizer that models quote-like reporting. In this configuration, we observe canary leakage in 50 of 52 canary-containing clusters (cluster-level leakage rate 0.961538), along with nonzero regex-based PII indicator counts. A minimal defense combining a minimum cluster-size publication threshold (k-min = 25) and regex-based redaction eliminates measured canary leakage and PII indicator hits in the reported run while maintaining a similar cluster-coherence proxy. We position this work as a societal impacts contribution centered on privacy risk measurement for published analytics artifacts rather than raw user data.", "AI": {"tldr": "CanaryBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u8bdd\u805a\u7c7b\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u690d\u5165\"\u91d1\u4e1d\u96c0\"\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u5426\u5728\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u7684\u805a\u5408\u5206\u6790\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u5bf9\u8bdd\u805a\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6458\u8981\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u4e2a\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f(PII)\u6216\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u8bdd\u672a\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6458\u8981\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCanaryBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1a1)\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u690d\u5165\"\u91d1\u4e1d\u96c0\"\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32(\u6a21\u62df\u654f\u611f\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26)\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff1b2)\u4f7f\u7528TF-IDF\u5d4c\u5165\u548ck-means\u805a\u7c7b\u5bf93000\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u8bdd(24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u9898)\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff1b3)\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u610f\u7684\u62bd\u53d6\u5f0f\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u5f15\u7528\u5f0f\u62a5\u544a\uff1b4)\u8bc4\u4f30\u91d1\u4e1d\u96c0\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u7684\u6cc4\u9732\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b\u91d1\u4e1d\u96c0\u768452\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c50\u4e2a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u91d1\u4e1d\u96c0\u6cc4\u9732(\u805a\u7c7b\u7ea7\u6cc4\u9732\u738796.15%)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u975e\u96f6\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7684PII\u6307\u6807\u8ba1\u6570\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u5c0f\u805a\u7c7b\u5927\u5c0f\u9608\u503c(k-min=25)\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7684\u8131\u654f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u91d1\u4e1d\u96c0\u6cc4\u9732\u548cPII\u6307\u6807\u547d\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CanaryBench\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\u5206\u6790\u4ea7\u7269(\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e)\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

However, these agents frequently access interfaces containing sensitive personal information, and screenshots are often transmitted to remote models, creating substantial privacy risks. These risks are particularly severe in GUI workflows: GUIs expose richer, more accessible private information, and privacy risks depend on interaction trajectories across sequential scenes. We propose GUIGuard, a three-stage framework for privacy-preserving GUI agents: (1) privacy recognition, (2) privacy protection, and (3) task execution under protection. We further construct GUIGuard-Bench, a cross-platform benchmark with 630 trajectories and 13,830 screenshots, annotated with region-level privacy grounding and fine-grained labels of risk level, privacy category, and task necessity. Evaluations reveal that existing agents exhibit limited privacy recognition, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 13.3% accuracy on Android and 1.4% on PC. Under privacy protection, task-planning semantics can still be maintained, with closed-source models showing stronger semantic consistency than open-source ones. Case studies on MobileWorld show that carefully designed protection strategies achieve higher task accuracy while preserving privacy. Our results highlight privacy recognition as a critical bottleneck for practical GUI agents.

LLM inputs are an unbounded, unstructured space. Consequently, effectively defending against these attacks requires proactive hardening strategies capable of continuously generating adaptive attack vectors to optimize LLM defense at runtime. We present HASTE (Hard-negative Attack Sample Training Engine): a systematic framework that iteratively engineers highly evasive prompts, within a modular optimization process, to continuously enhance detection efficacy for prompt-based attack techniques. The framework is agnostic to synthetic data generation methods, and can be generalized to evaluate prompt-injection detection efficacy, with and without fuzzing, for any hard-negative or hard-positive iteration strategy. Experimental evaluation of HASTE shows that hard negative mining successfully evades baseline detectors, reducing malicious prompt detection for baseline detectors by approximately 64%. However, when integrated with detection model re-training, it optimizes the efficacy of prompt detection models with significantly fewer iteration loops compared to relative baseline strategies. The HASTE framework supports both proactive and reactive hardening of LLM defenses and guardrails. Proactively, developers can leverage HASTE to dynamically stress-test prompt injection detection systems; efficiently identifying weaknesses and strengthening defensive posture. Reactively, HASTE can mimic newly observed attack types and rapidly bridge detection coverage by teaching HASTE-optimized detection models to identify them.", "AI": {"tldr": "HASTE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u89c4\u907f\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6280\u672f\u662fLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0cLLM\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u65e0\u754c\u4e14\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f3a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6301\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9632\u5fa1", "method": "HASTE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u5ea6\u89c4\u907f\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u786c\u8d1f\u4f8b/\u786c\u6b63\u4f8b\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528", "result": "\u786c\u8d1f\u4f8b\u6316\u6398\u6210\u529f\u89c4\u907f\u57fa\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u6076\u610f\u63d0\u793a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea664%\uff1b\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8fed\u4ee3\u5faa\u73af\u6b21\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c", "conclusion": "HASTE\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301LLM\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u6a21\u4eff\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u586b\u8865\u68c0\u6d4b\u8986\u76d6\u7a7a\u767d"}}

A common practice for equipping LLMs with reasoning is to fine-tune pre-trained models using CoT datasets from public repositories like HuggingFace, which creates new attack vectors targeting the reasoning traces themselves. While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our \"Thought-Transfer\" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset. Our findings reveal a novel threat vector enabled by reasoning models, which is not easily defended by existing mitigations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\"\u601d\u60f3\u8f6c\u79fb\"\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u95f4\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8be5\u653b\u51fb\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u7eb5\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u5f71\u54cd\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u7684LLM\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\"\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u7b7e\"\u6295\u6bd2\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe70%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd10-15%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dCoT\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u672c\u8eab\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u867d\u7136\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728CoT\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u690d\u5165\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u5305\u542b\u5e26\u6709\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u64cd\u7eb5\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u601d\u60f3\u8f6c\u79fb\"\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u64cd\u7eb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684CoT\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\"\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u7b7e\"\u6295\u6bd2\u3002\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u9700\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4ece\u672a\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe70%\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6ce8\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u6bd2\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd8\u80fd\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534710-15%\uff0c\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u6bd2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5a01\u80c1\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u4e0d\u6613\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u5bf9CoT\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8b66\u793a\u3002"}}

Some mitigation strategies against these attacks do exist, but they are not as far-reaching or as efficient as the CHERI architecture. CHERI uses capabilities to restrict pointers to certain regions of memory and with certain access restrictions. These capabilities are also used to implement \"compartmentalisation\": dividing a binary into smaller components with limited privilege, while adhering to the principle of least privilege. However, while this architecture successfully mitigates memory corruption attacks, the compartmentalisation mechanisms in place are less effective in containing malicious code to a separate compartment. This paper details four ways to bypass compartmentalisation, with a focus on Linux and BSD operating systems ported to this architecture. We find that although compartmentalisation is implemented in these two operating systems, simple bugs and attacks can still allow malicious code to bypass it. We conclude with mitigation measures to prevent these attacks, a proof-of-concept demonstrating their use, and recommendations for further securing Linux and BSD against unknown attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86CHERI\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u9694\u79bb\u673a\u5236\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u7ed5\u8fc7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u7684Linux\u548cBSD\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u4ecd\u53ef\u7ed5\u8fc7\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u548c\u52a0\u56fa\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "CHERI\u67b6\u6784\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5b58\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5185\u5b58\u7834\u574f\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9694\u79bb\u673a\u5236\u5728\u9632\u6b62\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7801\u7a81\u7834\u9694\u79bb\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793aCHERI\u67b6\u6784\u5728Linux\u548cBSD\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9694\u79bb\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u8be6\u7ec6\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u7ed5\u8fc7CHERI\u9694\u79bb\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u79fb\u690d\u5230CHERI\u67b6\u6784\u7684Linux\u548cBSD\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u6280\u672f\u7a81\u7834\u9694\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1Linux\u548cBSD\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728CHERI\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9694\u79bb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u4ecd\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u7ed5\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9694\u79bb\u7ed5\u8fc7\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u56faLinux\u548cBSD\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u5fa1\u672a\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347CHERI\u67b6\u6784\u9694\u79bb\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing SAST-based checks are noisy and often miss immature, context-dependent vulnerabilities, while standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by context windows and lack explicit tool use. Agentic AI, which combine LLMs with autonomous decision-making, tool invocation, and code navigation, offer a promising alternative, but their effectiveness for pre-commit secure code review is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce AgenticSCR, an agentic AI for secure code review for detecting immature vulnerabilities during the pre-commit stage, augmented by security-focused semantic memories. Using our own curated benchmark of immature vulnerabilities, tailored to the pre-commit secure code review, we empirically evaluate how accurate is our AgenticSCR for localizing, detecting, and explaining immature vulnerabilities. Our results show that AgenticSCR achieves at least 153% relatively higher percentage of correct code review comments than the static LLM-based baseline, and also substantially surpasses SAST tools. Moreover, AgenticSCR generates more correct comments in four out of five vulnerability types, consistently and significantly outperforming all other baselines. These findings highlight the importance of Agentic Secure Code Review, paving the way towards an emerging research area of immature vulnerability detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgenticSCR\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u63d0\u4ea4\u9636\u6bb5\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u63d0\u4ea4\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u65e9\u671f\u6355\u83b7\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u73b0\u6709SAST\u5de5\u5177\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u4e14\u5e38\u6f0f\u68c0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u800c\u72ec\u7acbLLM\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LLM\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u63d0\u4ea4\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgenticSCR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9884\u63d0\u4ea4\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u9884\u63d0\u4ea4\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u81ea\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\u6f0f\u6d1e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "AgenticSCR\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u81f3\u5c11\u83b7\u5f97153%\u76f8\u5bf9\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u8bc4\u8bba\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8aSAST\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5728\u4e94\u7c7b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u7c7b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u6b63\u786e\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u5174\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002AgenticSCR\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u5728\u9884\u63d0\u4ea4\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Two auxiliary agents, a Knowledge Updating Agent and a Prompt Optimization Agent, form a closed self-healing loop, when an attack bypasses detection, the system updates an evolving knowledgebase, and refines defense instructions.

Existing aligned LLMs predominantly respond to unsafe queries with refusals, which often begin with a fixed set of prefixes (I'm sorry). We demonstrate that this rigid refusal pattern is a vulnerability and introduce a novel \\textbf{refusal unlearning} technique that exploits it. Specifically, we fine-tune LLMs using merely 1,000 benign samples, where each response is prepended with a refusal prefix. The underlying intuition is to disrupt the refusal completion pathway, thereby driving the model to forget how to refuse while following harmful instructions. This intuition is further supported by theoretical proofs. We apply this approach to a total of 16 LLMs, including various open-source models from Llama, Qwen, and Gemma families, as well as closed-source models such as Gemini and GPT. Experimental results show that the safety scores of previously aligned LLMs degrade both consistently and substantially. Importantly, we verify that the observed gain cannot be attributed to plain fine-tuning or random prefix effects. Our findings suggest that current safety alignment may rely heavily on token sequence memorization rather than reasoning, motivating future work beyond simple refusal mechanisms.

They can be deployed across diverse applications, including traffic monitoring, disaster response, environmental monitoring, and numerous other domains. However, this integration introduces novel security challenges that must be addressed to ensure safe and trustworthy urban operations. This paper provides a structured, evidence-based synthesis of UAV applications in smart cities and their associated security challenges as reported in the literature over the last decade, with particular emphasis on developments from 2019 to 2025. We categorize these challenges into two primary classes: 1) cyber-attacks targeting the communication infrastructure of UAVs and 2) unwanted or unauthorized physical intrusions by UAVs themselves. We examine the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in developing intrusion detection mechanisms to mitigate these security threats. We analyze how AI-based methods, such as machine/deep learning for anomaly detection and computer vision for object recognition, can play a pivotal role in enhancing UAV security through unified detection systems that address both cyber and physical threats. Furthermore, we consolidate publicly available UAV datasets across network traffic and vision modalities suitable for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) development and evaluation. The paper concludes by identifying ten key research directions, including scalability, robustness, explainability, data scarcity, automation, hybrid detection, large language models, multimodal approaches, federated learning, and privacy preservation.

Writing efficient FHE code is a complex task requiring cryptographic expertise, and finding the optimal sequence of program transformations is often intractable. In this paper, we propose CHEHAB RL, a novel framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) to automate FHE code optimization. Instead of relying on predefined heuristics or combinatorial search, our method trains an RL agent to learn an effective policy for applying a sequence of rewriting rules to automatically vectorize scalar FHE code while reducing instruction latency and noise growth. The proposed approach supports the optimization of both structured and unstructured code. To train the agent, we synthesize a diverse dataset of computations using a large language model (LLM). We integrate our proposed approach into the CHEHAB FHE compiler and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, comparing its performance against Coyote, a state-of-the-art vectorizing FHE compiler. The results show that our approach generates code that is $5.3\\times$ faster in execution, accumulates $2.54\\times$ less noise, while the compilation process itself is $27.9\\times$ faster than Coyote (geometric means).", "AI": {"tldr": "CHEHAB RL \u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668 Coyote \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e865.3\u500d\u6267\u884c\u52a0\u901f\u30012.54\u500d\u566a\u58f0\u964d\u4f4e\u548c27.9\u500d\u7f16\u8bd1\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\uff08FHE\uff09\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u3002\u7f16\u5199\u9ad8\u6548\u7684FHE\u4ee3\u7801\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8f6c\u6362\u5e8f\u5217\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCHEHAB RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u91cd\u5199\u89c4\u5219\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u6807\u91cfFHE\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u6307\u4ee4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u957f\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u5316FHE\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668Coyote\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCHEHAB RL\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb5.3\u500d\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u79ef\u7d2f\u5c112.54\u500d\uff0c\u7f16\u8bd1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u5feb27.9\u500d\uff08\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u5747\u503c\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "CHEHAB RL\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u5316FHE\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aFHE\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This also applies if the same addresses are used in different cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, cross-chain address reuse appears to be a recurring phenomenon, especially in EVM-based designs. Previous works performed either direct address matching, or basic format conversion, to identify such cases. However, seemingly incompatible address formats e.g., in Bitcoin and Ethereum, can also be derived from the same public keys, since they rely on the same cryptographic primitives. In this paper, we therefore focus on the underlying public keys to discover reuse within, as well as across, different cryptocurrency networks, enabling us to also match incompatible address formats. Specifically, we analyze key reuse across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Zcash and Tron. Our results reveal that cryptographic keys are extensively and actively reused across these networks, negatively impacting both privacy and security of their users. We are hence the first to expose and quantify cross-chain key reuse between UTXO and account-based cryptocurrencies. Moreover, we devise novel clustering methods across these different cryptocurrency networks that do not rely on heuristics and instead link entities by their knowledge of the underlying secret key.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u94fe\u5bc6\u94a5\u91cd\u7528\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5e95\u5c42\u516c\u94a5\u800c\u975e\u5730\u5740\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728UTXO\u548c\u8d26\u6237\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5bc6\u94a5\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5730\u5740\u91cd\u7528\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u8de8\u94fe\u5730\u5740\u91cd\u7528\u73b0\u8c61\u5728EVM\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u5e38\u89c1\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5730\u5740\u5339\u914d\u6216\u57fa\u672c\u683c\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u683c\u5f0f\u5730\u5740\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u81ea\u76f8\u540c\u516c\u94a5\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u5e95\u5c42\u516c\u94a5\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u94fe\u5bc6\u94a5\u91cd\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5e95\u5c42\u516c\u94a5\u800c\u975e\u5730\u5740\u683c\u5f0f\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u5bc6\u94a5\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u3001\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u3001\u83b1\u7279\u5e01\u3001\u72d7\u72d7\u5e01\u3001Zcash\u548c\u6ce2\u573a\u7b49\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u805a\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e95\u5c42\u79c1\u94a5\u7684\u638c\u63e1\u6765\u94fe\u63a5\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u52a0\u5bc6\u5bc6\u94a5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e14\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5730\u88ab\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9996\u6b21\u5728UTXO\u548c\u8d26\u6237\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4e4b\u95f4\u66b4\u9732\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u8de8\u94fe\u5bc6\u94a5\u91cd\u7528\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u94fe\u5bc6\u94a5\u91cd\u7528\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u8d77\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u94a5\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u4f20\u7edf\u5730\u5740\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We complement it with an execution-feasibility model that quantifies co-inclusion constraints under private mempools. Second, we examine execution constraints in the absence of builder markets: without guaranteed atomic inclusion, attackers must rely on sequencer ordering, redundant submissions, and priority fee placement, which renders sandwiching probabilistic rather than deterministic. Third, using transaction-level data from major rollups, we show that naive heuristics overstate sandwich activity. We find that the majority of flagged patterns are false positives and that the median net return for these attacks is negative. Our results suggest that sandwiching, while endemic and profitable on Ethereum L1, is rare, unprofitable, and largely absent in rollups with private mempools. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions, refine measurement of MEV in L2s, and inform the design of sequencing policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u79c1\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u7684\u4ee5\u592a\u574aRollup\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u653b\u51fb\uff08sandwich attacks\uff09\u867d\u7136\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u7f55\u89c1\u4e14\u65e0\u5229\u53ef\u56fe\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ee5\u592a\u574aL1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u5f62\u6210\u9c9c\u660e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5177\u6709\u79c1\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u7684\u4ee5\u592a\u574aRollup\u4e2d\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u76c8\u5229\u6027\u548c\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8eLayer 2\u4e2dMEV\uff08\u77ff\u5de5\u53ef\u63d0\u53d6\u4ef7\u503c\uff09\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u6700\u4f18\u524d\u540e\u8fd0\u884c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u79c1\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u4e0b\u7684\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u6784\u5efa\u8005\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b4\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u8981Rollup\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u6570\u88ab\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u8bef\u62a5\uff1b2\uff09\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u51c0\u56de\u62a5\u4e3a\u8d1f\u503c\uff1b3\uff09\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5177\u6709\u79c1\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u7684Rollup\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\u3001\u65e0\u5229\u53ef\u56fe\u4e14\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ee5\u592a\u574aL1\u7684\u666e\u904d\u76c8\u5229\u60c5\u51b5\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u4ee5\u592a\u574aL1\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u4e14\u76c8\u5229\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5177\u6709\u79c1\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u7684Rollup\u4e2d\u5374\u7f55\u89c1\u4e14\u65e0\u5229\u53ef\u56fe\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u7ec6\u5316\u4e86L2\u4e2dMEV\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Traditional knowledge-based authentication remains rigid, requiring exact word-for-word string matches that fail to accommodate natural human memory and linguistic variation. Meanwhile, fraud-detection pipelines struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving scam behaviors, leading to high false-positive rates and frequent retraining cycles required. This work introduces two complementary LLM-enabled solutions, namely, an LLM-assisted authentication mechanism that evaluates semantic correctness rather than exact wording, supported by document segmentation and a hybrid scoring method combining LLM judgement with cosine-similarity metrics and a RAG-based fraud-detection pipeline that grounds LLM reasoning in curated evidence to reduce hallucinations and adapt to emerging scam patterns without model retraining. Experiments show that the authentication system accepts 99.5% of legitimate non-exact answers while maintaining a 0,1% false-acceptance rate, and that the RAG-enhanced fraud detection reduces false positives from 17.2% to 35%. Together, these findings demonstrate that LLMs can significantly improve both usability and robustness in security workflows, offering a more adaptive , explainable, and human-aligned approach to authentication and fraud detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cdLLM\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u4ee5\u8ddf\u4e0a\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u8bc8\u9a97\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "1) LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8ba4\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u6863\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u800c\u975e\u7cbe\u786e\u63aa\u8f9e\uff1b2) RAG\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u5c06LLM\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cbe\u9009\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u5174\u8bc8\u9a97\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a5\u53d799.5%\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u975e\u7cbe\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u63010.1%\u7684\u8bef\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\uff1bRAG\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c06\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u4ece17.2%\u964d\u4f4e\u52303.5%\uff08\u539f\u6587\u4e3a35%\uff0c\u5e94\u4e3a\u7b14\u8bef\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u8bc1\u548c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this process, the Red Team exposes vulnerabilities, driving the Blue Team to learning effective solutions without parameter updates. We validate our framework across two challenging domains: dynamic code hardening against CVEs and guardrail optimization against jailbreaks. Our empirical results show that this interaction compels the Blue Team to learn fundamental defensive principles, leading to robust remediations that are not merely overfitted to specific exploits.

The evolution of these frameworks culminates in eIDAS 2.0, whose origins trace back to the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC, the first EU-wide legal foundation for the use of electronic signatures in cross-border electronic transactions. As technological capabilities advanced, the initial eIDAS 1.0 framework was increasingly criticized for its limitations and lack of comprehensiveness. Emerging decentralized approaches further exposed these shortcomings and introduced the possibility of integrating innovative identity paradigms, such as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) models.\n  In this article, we analyse key provisions of the eIDAS 2.0 Regulation and its accompanying recitals, drawing on existing literature to identify legislative gaps and implementation challenges. Furthermore, we examine the European Digital Identity Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF), assessing its proposed guidelines and evaluating the extent to which its emerging implementations align with SSI principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u6b27\u76dfeIDAS 2.0\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u6cd5\u89c4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u4ece1999\u5e74\u7535\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u6307\u4ee4\u5230eIDAS 1.0\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u7acb\u6cd5\u7a7a\u767d\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b27\u6d32\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6(ARF)\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u8eab\u4efd(SSI)\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b27\u76df\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u5021\u8bae\u57fa\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u968f\u7740\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0ceIDAS 1.0\u6846\u67b6\u56e0\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u6279\u8bc4\uff0c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u8eab\u4efd(SSI)\u7b49\u521b\u65b0\u8eab\u4efd\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790eIDAS 2.0\u6cd5\u89c4\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u8bf4\u660e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6761\u6b3e\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u8bc6\u522b\u7acb\u6cd5\u7a7a\u767d\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5ba1\u67e5\u6b27\u6d32\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6(ARF)\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5176\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e0eSSI\u539f\u5219\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u7ae0\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86eIDAS 2.0\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u7a7a\u767d\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86ARF\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u8eab\u4efd(SSI)\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5951\u5408\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b27\u76df\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b8c\u5584\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b27\u76df\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u4ece1999\u5e74\u7535\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u6307\u4ee4\u53d1\u5c55\u5230eIDAS 2.0\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u7acb\u6cd5\u7a7a\u767d\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6574\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u8eab\u4efd(SSI)\u7b49\u521b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002"}}

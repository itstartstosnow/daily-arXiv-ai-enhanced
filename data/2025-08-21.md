### [2] [CCFC: Core & Core-Full-Core Dual-Track Defense for LLM Jailbreak Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14128)
*Jiaming Hu,Haoyu Wang,Debarghya Mukherjee,Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CCFC是一个双轨道的提示级防御框架，通过语义核心提取和双轨评估来抵御LLM的越狱攻击，将攻击成功率降低50-75%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型面临提示注入和结构感知越狱攻击的严重安全挑战，需要有效的防御机制

Method: 使用少样本提示提取查询语义核心，通过核心轨道忽略对抗性干扰，通过核心-完整-核心轨道破坏攻击结构模式，最后基于安全一致性检查选择响应

Result: 相比最先进防御方法，CCFC将DeepInception、GCG等强对抗攻击的成功率降低50-75%，且在良性查询上保持高质量响应

Conclusion: CCFC提供了一个实用有效的解决方案，在不牺牲响应质量的前提下显著提升LLM部署的安全性

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious challenge to the safe deployment of large
language models (LLMs). We introduce CCFC (Core & Core-Full-Core), a
dual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs'
vulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks.
CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot
prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a
core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or
prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural
patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response
is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring
robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC
cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against
strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on
benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer
LLM deployment.

### [3] [Two Birds with One Stone: Multi-Task Detection and Attribution of LLM-Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14190)
*Zixin Rao,Youssef Mohamed,Shang Liu,Zeyan Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DA-MTL是一个多任务学习框架，同时解决AI文本检测和作者归属两个任务，在多种语言和LLM上表现优异，并能抵抗对抗性混淆技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI文本检测方法主要针对英语且只关注检测，而作者归属任务研究较少但法医分析中很重要，需要同时解决这两个相关任务。

Method: 提出了DA-MTL多任务学习框架，同时处理文本检测和作者归属，通过共享任务间的见解来提升两个任务的性能。

Result: 在9个数据集和4个骨干模型上评估，DA-MTL在多种语言和LLM来源上都表现出色，并能有效抵抗对抗性攻击。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM行为分析和检测/作者归属任务的泛化提供了宝贵见解，证明了多任务学习在相关NLP任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have demonstrated
remarkable abilities in generating natural language. However, they also pose
security and integrity challenges. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on
distinguishing AI-generated content from human-written text, with most
solutions tailored for English. Meanwhile, authorship attribution--determining
which specific LLM produced a given text--has received comparatively little
attention despite its importance in forensic analysis. In this paper, we
present DA-MTL, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously addresses
both text detection and authorship attribution. We evaluate DA-MTL on nine
datasets and four backbone models, demonstrating its strong performance across
multiple languages and LLM sources. Our framework captures each task's unique
characteristics and shares insights between them, which boosts performance in
both tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of cross-modal and
cross-lingual patterns and assess the framework's robustness against
adversarial obfuscation techniques. Our findings offer valuable insights into
LLM behavior and the generalization of both detection and authorship
attribution.

### [4] [A Taxonomy and Methodology for Proof-of-Location Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14230)
*Eduardo Brito,Fernando Castillo,Liina Kamm,Amnir Hadachi,Ulrich Norbisrath*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的框架来帮助从业者选择适合特定应用需求的Proof-of-Location（PoL）系统架构，包括分类学和方法论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字社会越来越依赖物理存在的可信证明，但传统定位方法缺乏密码学保证，容易受到欺骗攻击。PoL研究虽然发展迅速，但设计空间复杂，需要系统化的指导框架。

Method: 提出了包含四个核心领域的分类学：（1）密码学保证（2）时空同步（3）信任和见证模型（4）交互和开销。基于此引入了将应用需求映射到合适PoL架构的方法论。

Result: 通过三个用例（零售电子优惠券、供应链审计和物理电子投票）展示了方法论的应用，说明不同约束如何影响协议选择。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建安全、可扩展和可互操作的PoL系统提供了结构化方法，帮助从业者根据具体需求选择合适的架构设计。

Abstract: Digital societies increasingly rely on trustworthy proofs of physical
presence for services such as supply-chain tracking, e-voting, ride-sharing,
and location-based rewards. Yet, traditional localization methods often lack
cryptographic guarantees of where and when an entity was present, leaving them
vulnerable to spoofing, replay, or collusion attacks. In response, research on
Proof-of-Location (PoL) has emerged, with recent approaches combining distance
bounding, distributed consensus, and privacy-enhancing techniques to enable
verifiable, tamper-resistant location claims.
  As the design space for PoL systems grows in complexity, this paper provides
a unified framework to help practitioners navigate diverse application needs.
We first propose a taxonomy identifying four core domains: (1) cryptographic
guarantees, (2) spatio-temporal synchronization, (3) trust and witness models,
and (4) interaction and overhead. Building on this, we introduce a methodology
to map application-specific requirements onto appropriate PoL architectures. We
illustrate this process through three use cases (retail e-coupons, supply chain
auditing, and physical e-voting), each showing how different constraints shape
protocol choices. Overall, this work offers a structured approach to building
secure, scalable, and interoperable PoL systems.

### [5] [SaMOSA: Sandbox for Malware Orchestration and Side-Channel Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14261)
*Meet Udeshi,Venkata Sai Charan Putrevu,Prashanth Krishnamurthy,Ramesh Karri,Farshad Khorrami*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SaMOSA是一个模块化、可定制的Linux沙箱框架，专为OT和CPS系统的恶意软件分析设计，能够捕获四个时间同步的侧信道数据，支持多种架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着针对OT和CPS系统的Linux嵌入式设备恶意软件激增，现有沙箱功能有限，无法满足全面的恶意软件动态分析需求。

Method: 开发SaMOSA沙箱框架，通过FakeNet模拟网络服务，提供管道钩子进行环境编排和定制，捕获系统调用、网络活动、磁盘活动和硬件性能计数器四个侧信道。

Result: SaMOSA相比现有沙箱捕获更多侧信道，支持x86-64、ARM64和PowerPC 64三种架构，并通过三个恶意软件家族的案例研究验证了其优势。

Conclusion: SaMOSA填补了Linux恶意软件分析领域的空白，提供了一个可适应多种分析任务的模块化沙箱框架。

Abstract: Cyber-attacks on operational technology (OT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS)
have increased tremendously in recent years with the proliferation of malware
targeting Linux-based embedded devices of OT and CPS systems. Comprehensive
malware detection requires dynamic analysis of execution behavior in addition
to static analysis of binaries. Safe execution of malware in a manner that
captures relevant behaviors via side-channels requires a sandbox environment.
Existing Linux sandboxes are built for specific tasks, only capture one or two
side-channels, and do not offer customization for different analysis tasks. We
present the SaMOSA Linux sandbox that allows emulation of Linux malwares while
capturing time-synchronized side-channels from four sources. SaMOSA
additionally provides emulation of network services via FakeNet, and allows
orchestration and customization of the sandbox environment via pipeline hooks.
In comparison to existing Linux sandboxes, SaMOSA captures more side-channels
namely system calls, network activity, disk activity, and hardware performance
counters. It supports three architectures predominantly used in OT and CPS
namely x86-64, ARM64, and PowerPC 64. SaMOSA fills a gap in Linux malware
analysis by providing a modular and customizable sandbox framework that can be
adapted for many malware analysis tasks. We present three case studies of three
different malware families to demonstrate the advantages of SaMOSA.

### [6] [Differentially Private aggregate hints in mev-share](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14284)
*Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach,Sarisht Wadhwa*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出使用差分隐私聚合提示来增强mev-share系统，让用户能够量化隐私泄露并更好地要求返利，同时为搜索者提供有价值的信息以提高MEV提取效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在MEV提取中信息共享与隐私保护的矛盾 - 搜索者需要更多信息来维持链上交易所效率和盈利能力，而用户希望防止前置交易而保留信息。

Method: 采用差分隐私（DP）聚合提示作为新型提示，在可信策展人模型下设计聚合提示，利用随机抽样防御女巫攻击并增强用户隐私。

Result: DP聚合提示使用户能够正式量化对搜索者的隐私损失，从而更好地估计要求的返利水平，同时为搜索者提供改进的后置交易提取和前置交易预防的有价值提示。

Conclusion: 差分隐私聚合提示可以增强mev-share系统，平衡用户隐私保护和搜索者信息需求，为双方创造更好的MEV提取环境。

Abstract: Flashbots recently released mev-share to empower users with control over the
amount of information they share with searchers for extracting Maximal
Extractable Value (MEV). Searchers require more information to maintain
on-chain exchange efficiency and profitability, while users aim to prevent
frontrunning by withholding information. After analyzing two searching
strategies in mev-share to reason about searching techniques, this paper
introduces Differentially-Private (DP) aggregate hints as a new type of hints
to disclose information quantitatively. DP aggregate hints enable users to
formally quantify their privacy loss to searchers, and thus better estimate the
level of rebates to ask in return. The paper discusses the current properties
and privacy loss in mev-share and lays out how DP aggregate hints could enhance
the system for both users and searchers. We leverage Differential Privacy in
the Trusted Curator Model to design our aggregate hints. Additionally, we
explain how random sampling can defend against sybil attacks and amplify
overall user privacy while providing valuable hints to searchers for improved
backrunning extraction and frontrunning prevention.

### [7] [MultiFuzz: A Dense Retrieval-based Multi-Agent System for Network Protocol Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14300)
*Youssef Maklad,Fares Wael,Ali Hamdi,Wael Elsersy,Khaled Shaban*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MultiFuzz是一个基于密集检索的多智能体协议模糊测试系统，通过RAG管道整合协议文档语义，使用专门智能体协作生成结构化输出，显著提升分支覆盖率和协议状态探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协议模糊测试技术（如AFL）对复杂协议语法语义理解有限，种子变异策略僵化。虽然ChatAFL引入了LLM指导模糊测试，但仍存在输出不可靠、幻觉问题以及LLM对协议规范知识假设等问题。

Method: 使用密集检索技术将协议文档（RFC）构建向量数据库，建立RAG管道；采用多智能体系统，通过模块化智能体组协作，利用思维链推理动态调整模糊测试策略；结合语义感知上下文检索和结构化工具辅助推理。

Result: 在实时流协议（RTSP）上的实验表明，MultiFuzz相比NSFuzz、AFLNet和ChatAFL等先进模糊测试工具，显著提高了分支覆盖率，探索了更深层的协议状态和转换。

Conclusion: MultiFuzz通过结合密集检索、智能体协调和语言模型推理，建立了自主协议模糊测试的新范式，为未来智能基于智能体的模糊测试系统提供了可扩展和可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based
systems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of
complex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works,
such as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol
fuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider
exploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like
unreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about
protocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense
retrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by
integrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and
structured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of
protocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database
for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to
generate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating
protocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic
constraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups
of agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically
adapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge.
Experimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate
that MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper
protocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as
NSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic
coordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new
paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible
foundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.

### [8] [Precision over Noise: Tailoring S3 Public Access Detection to Reduce False Positives in Cloud Security Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14402)
*Dikshant,Geetika Verma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现云安全解决方案在Amazon S3公开访问警报中产甘过高于80%的假正确警报，通过自定义检测逻辑显著提升了警报准确性和分析师效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云安全解决方案过多的假正确警报导致分析师疲劳和运维效率下降，需要解决Amazon S3公开访问警报中长期存在的假正确问题。

Method: 在模拟生产环境中测试超1000个Amazon S3桶，创建了一个统一的自定义检测逻辑"S3公开访问验证和数据泄漏"，系统扫描ACL配置、桶策略、公开泄漏指标和敏感数据存在情况。

Result: 自定义检测逻辑显著减少了假正确警报，提高了警报准确性，为安全分析师节省了大量时间，验证了一种可执行的解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过自定义检测逻辑可以有效解决云安全警报中的假正确问题，提升检测准确性和运维效率，适用于符合规范要求的云环境。

Abstract: Excessive and spurious alert generation by cloud security solutions is a root
cause of analyst fatigue and operational inefficiencies. In this study, the
long-standing issue of false positives from publicly accessible alerts in
Amazon S3, as generated by a licensed cloud-native security solution, is
examined. In a simulated production test environment, which consisted of over
1,000 Amazon S3 buckets with diverse access configurations, it was discovered
that over 80\% of the alerts generated by default rules were classified as
false positives, thus demonstrating the severity of the detection issue. This
severely impacted detection accuracy and generated a heavier workload for
analysts due to redundant manual triage efforts. For addressing this problem,
custom detection logic was created as an exercise of the native rule
customization capabilities of the solution. A unified titled ``S3 Public Access
Validation and Data Exposure'' was created in an effort to consolidate
different forms of alerts into one, context-aware logic that systematically
scans ACL configurations, bucket policies, indicators of public exposure, and
the presence of sensitive data, and then marks only those S3 buckets that
indeed denote security risk and are publicly exposed on the internet with no
authentication. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in false
positives, more precise alert fidelity, and significant time saving for
security analysts, thus demonstrating an actionable and reproducible solution
to enhance the accuracy of security alerting in compliance-focused cloud
environments.

### [9] [CoFacS -- Simulating a Complete Factory to Study the Security of Interconnected Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14526)
*Stefan Lenz,David Schachtschneider,Simon Jonas,Liam Tirpitz,Sandra Geisler,Martin Henze*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CoFacS是首个完整工厂模拟系统，能够复制整个生产线并集成真实工业应用，最大偏差仅0.11%，支持端到端网络安全研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业数字化带来安全漏洞，现有测试床只能模拟部分生产线，无法进行端到端网络安全评估

Method: 开发CoFacS完整工厂模拟系统，验证其与物理模型工厂的一致性，并通过案例研究展示其应用

Result: CoFacS与物理参考系统的最大偏差为0.11%，能够准确模拟现实世界行为

Conclusion: CoFacS为工业网络安全研究提供了有效的端到端测试平台，支持物理攻击和网络攻击的影响研究

Abstract: While the digitization of industrial factories provides tremendous
improvements for the production of goods, it also renders such systems
vulnerable to serious cyber-attacks. To research, test, and validate security
measures protecting industrial networks against such cyber-attacks, the
security community relies on testbeds to simulate industrial systems, as
utilizing live systems endangers costly components or even human life. However,
existing testbeds focus on individual parts of typically complex production
lines in industrial factories. Consequently, the impact of cyber-attacks on
industrial networks as well as the effectiveness of countermeasures cannot be
evaluated in an end-to-end manner. To address this issue and facilitate
research on novel security mechanisms, we present CoFacS, the first COmplete
FACtory Simulation that replicates an entire production line and affords the
integration of real-life industrial applications. To showcase that CoFacS
accurately captures real-world behavior, we validate it against a physical
model factory widely used in security research. We show that CoFacS has a
maximum deviation of 0.11% to the physical reference, which enables us to study
the impact of physical attacks or network-based cyber-attacks. Moreover, we
highlight how CoFacS enables security research through two cases studies
surrounding attack detection and the resilience of 5G-based industrial
communication against jamming.

### [10] [DOPA: Stealthy and Generalizable Backdoor Attacks from a Single Client under Challenging Federated Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14530)
*Xuezheng Qin,Ruwei Huang,Xiaolong Tang,Feng Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DOPA是一种针对联邦学习的后门攻击框架，通过模拟异构训练动态和寻找优化路径共识，在严格限制下实现高效隐蔽的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习后门攻击方法依赖理想化假设，在真实世界约束（有限攻击者控制、非IID数据分布、防御机制）下效果不佳。

Method: 提出DOPA框架，模拟异构本地训练动态，通过跨不同优化路径的一致性信号指导优化，制作通用有效的隐蔽后门触发器。

Result: 在12种防御策略、2种模型架构、2个数据集和不同非IID设置下验证，DOPA在单客户端黑盒稀疏参与威胁模型下实现高攻击成功率、低精度损失、低运行时和长期持久性。

Conclusion: DOPA展示了更实用的攻击范式，为联邦学习系统设计鲁棒防御策略提供了新视角。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly adopted for privacy-preserving
collaborative training, but its decentralized nature makes it particularly
susceptible to backdoor attacks. Existing attack methods, however, often rely
on idealized assumptions and fail to remain effective under real-world
constraints, such as limited attacker control, non-IID data distributions, and
the presence of diverse defense mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose
DOPA (Divergent Optimization Path Attack), a novel framework that simulates
heterogeneous local training dynamics and seeks consensus across divergent
optimization trajectories to craft universally effective and stealthy backdoor
triggers. By leveraging consistency signals across simulated paths to guide
optimization, DOPA overcomes the challenge of heterogeneity-induced instability
and achieves practical attack viability under stringent federated constraints.
We validate DOPA on a comprehensive suite of 12 defense strategies, two model
architectures (ResNet18/VGG16), two datasets (CIFAR-10/TinyImageNet), and both
mild and extreme non-IID settings. Despite operating under a single-client,
black-box, and sparsely participating threat model, DOPA consistently achieves
high attack success, minimal accuracy degradation, low runtime, and long-term
persistence. These results demonstrate a more practical attack paradigm,
offering new perspectives for designing robust defense strategies in federated
learning systems

### [11] [Leuvenshtein: Efficient FHE-based Edit Distance Computation with Single Bootstrap per Cell](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14568)
*Wouter Legiest,Jan-Pieter D'Anvers,Bojan Spasic,Nam-Luc Tran,Ingrid Verbauwhede*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Leuvenshtein的新型全同态加密编辑距离计算算法，将每个单元格所需的可编程自举操作从94次减少到1次，性能提升最高达278倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编辑距离计算在金融和基因组学等领域至关重要，但传统算法在全同态加密环境下计算成本过高，需要优化

Method: 基于第三代全同态加密方案TFHE，开发了优化的Leuvenshtein算法，减少可编程自举操作次数，并提出了高效的字符相等性检查方法

Result: 相比最佳TFHE实现快278倍，比优化的Wagner-Fisher算法快39倍；当有一个未加密输入时可额外获得3倍加速

Conclusion: Leuvenshtein算法显著降低了全同态加密环境下的编辑距离计算成本，为隐私保护的生物信息学应用提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to calculating the Levenshtein (edit)
distance within the framework of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE),
specifically targeting third-generation schemes like TFHE. Edit distance
computations are essential in applications across finance and genomics, such as
DNA sequence alignment. We introduce an optimised algorithm that significantly
reduces the cost of edit distance calculations called Leuvenshtein. This
algorithm specifically reduces the number of programmable bootstraps (PBS)
needed per cell of the calculation, lowering it from approximately 94
operations -- required by the conventional Wagner-Fisher algorithm -- to just
1. Additionally, we propose an efficient method for performing equality checks
on characters, reducing ASCII character comparisons to only 2 PBS operations.
Finally, we explore the potential for further performance improvements by
utilising preprocessing when one of the input strings is unencrypted. Our
Leuvenshtein achieves up to $278\times$ faster performance compared to the best
available TFHE implementation and up to $39\times$ faster than an optimised
implementation of the Wagner-Fisher algorithm. Moreover, when offline
preprocessing is possible due to the presence of one unencrypted input on the
server side, an additional $3\times$ speedup can be achieved.

### [12] [Foe for Fraud: Transferable Adversarial Attacks in Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14699)
*Jan Lum Fok,Qingwen Zeng,Shiping Chen,Oscar Fawkes,Huaming Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文研究了信用卡欺诈检测(CCFD)机器学习模型在面对对抗性攻击时的脆弱性，特别是在表格数据上的表现，发现即使是微小扰动也能有效攻击模型。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然对抗性攻击在计算机视觉领域已被广泛研究，但在金融领域特别是信用卡欺诈检测的表格数据模型中的影响尚未充分探索，这些潜在漏洞对金融安全构成重大威胁。

Method: 提出了一个整体框架，在黑白盒攻击设置下将基于梯度的攻击方法应用于表格信用卡交易数据，并测试对抗样本在不同模型间的迁移性。

Result: 研究发现表格数据同样容易受到细微扰动的影响，基于梯度的攻击方法产生的对抗样本对非梯度模型也有效，证实了攻击的普遍有效性。

Conclusion: 金融科技从业者需要提高对机器学习模型安全性和可信度的认识，必须为CCFD算法开发鲁棒的防御机制以应对对抗性攻击威胁。

Abstract: Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is a critical application of Machine
Learning (ML) in the financial sector, where accurately identifying fraudulent
transactions is essential for mitigating financial losses. ML models have
demonstrated their effectiveness in fraud detection task, in particular with
the tabular dataset. While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in
computer vision and deep learning, their impacts on the ML models, particularly
those trained on CCFD tabular datasets, remains largely unexplored. These
latent vulnerabilities pose significant threats to the security and stability
of the financial industry, especially in high-value transactions where losses
could be substantial. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a holistic
framework that investigate the robustness of CCFD ML model against adversarial
perturbations under different circumstances. Specifically, the gradient-based
attack methods are incorporated into the tabular credit card transaction data
in both black- and white-box adversarial attacks settings. Our findings confirm
that tabular data is also susceptible to subtle perturbations, highlighting the
need for heightened awareness among financial technology practitioners
regarding ML model security and trustworthiness. Furthermore, the experiments
by transferring adversarial samples from gradient-based attack method to
non-gradient-based models also verify our findings. Our results demonstrate
that such attacks remain effective, emphasizing the necessity of developing
robust defenses for CCFD algorithms.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的隐私保护智能计量协议，通过差分隐私、哈希链等技术，在保护用户隐私的同时实现励势性价值添加服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电表虽然提供了净确计费、断电检测等服务，但消费数据报告可能泄露用户生活方式、政治倾向等隐私信息，或被第三方利用，存在隐私风险。

Method: 采用局部差分隐私、哈希链、盲签名、假名、时间聚合和匿名覆盖网络等技术，向公用事业单位报告可调节粒度的粗粒度数据。

Result: 性能方面：使用1024位RSA密钥、7天周期、每天4次报告，协议运行时间约0.51秒，内存消耗约4.5MB。隐私方面：能抵抗半信任和不信任攻击者，防止身份泄露同时支持自动令牌兑换。

Conclusion: 该协议在保护消费者隐私的同时，保持了数据的实用性，通过轻量级设计实现了励势性价值添加服务，为智能电网中的隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of smart grids and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) has
revolutionized energy management. Unlike traditional power grids, smart grids
benefit from two-way communication through AMI, which surpasses earlier
automated meter reading (AMR). AMI enables diverse demand- and supply-side
utilities such as accurate billing, outage detection, real-time grid control,
load forecasting, and value-added services. Smart meters play a key role by
delivering consumption values at predefined intervals to the utility provider
(UP). However, such reports may raise privacy concerns, as adversaries can
infer lifestyle patterns, political orientations, and the types of electrical
devices in a household, or even sell the data to third parties (TP) such as
insurers. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, privacy-preserving smart
metering protocol for incentive-based value-added services. The scheme employs
local differential privacy, hash chains, blind digital signatures, pseudonyms,
temporal aggregation, and anonymous overlay networks to report coarse-grained
values with adjustable granularity to the UP. This protects consumers' privacy
while preserving data utility. The scheme prevents identity disclosure while
enabling automatic token redemption. From a performance perspective, our
results show that with a 1024-bit RSA key, a 7-day duration, and four reports
per day, our protocol runs in approximately 0.51s and consumes about 4.5 MB of
memory. From a privacy perspective, the protocol resists semi-trusted and
untrusted adversaries.

### [14] [A Collusion-Resistance Privacy-Preserving Smart Metering Protocol for Operational Utility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14744)
*Farid Zaredar,Morteza Amini*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种抗共谋的隐私保护聚合协议，用于智能电表数据聚合，通过同态加密和数据扰动技术保护用户隐私，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网虽然提高了能源效率和可靠性，但细粒度用电数据会泄露用户隐私，电力公司可能通过分析时间序列数据获取用户日常活动信息。

Method: 采用部分加法同态加密（Paillier密码系统）、数据聚合、数据扰动和数据最小化技术，构建抗共谋的隐私保护聚合协议。

Result: 协议在1024位密钥下的总执行时间约为2.21秒，通过归一化条件熵（NCE）评估显示，增加噪声规模可提高隐私保护水平（NCE值接近1）。

Conclusion: 该协议在保持高效计算性能的同时，有效保护了用户隐私，通过多种隐私保护技术的结合实现了智能电表数据的隐私安全聚合。

Abstract: Modern grids have adopted advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to
facilitate bidirectional communication between smart meters and control
centers. This enables smart meters to report consumption values at predefined
intervals to utility providers for purposes including demand balancing, load
forecasting, dynamic billing, and operational efficiency. Compared to
traditional power grids, smart grids offer advantages such as enhanced
reliability, improved energy efficiency, and increased security. However,
utility providers can compromise user privacy by analyzing fine-grained
readings and extracting individuals' daily activities from this time-series
data. To address this concern, we propose a collusion-resistant,
privacy-preserving aggregation protocol for smart metering in operational
services. Our protocol ensures privacy by leveraging techniques such as
partially additive homomorphic encryption, aggregation, data perturbation, and
data minimization. The scheme aggregates perturbed readings using the additive
homomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem to provide results for
multiple operational purposes. We evaluate the protocol in terms of both
performance and privacy. Computational, memory, and communication overhead were
examined. The total execution time with 1024-bit key size is about 2.21
seconds. We also evaluated privacy through the normalized conditional entropy
(NCE) metric. Higher NCE values, closer to 1, indicate stronger privacy. By
increasing noise scale, the NCE value rises, showing perturbed values retain
minimal information about the original, thereby reducing risks. Overall,
evaluation demonstrates the protocol's efficiency while employing various
privacy-preserving techniques.

Conclusion: 该指南旨在帮助研究团队以信心和清晰度而非困惑来满足新的伦理要求

Abstract: Stakeholder-based ethics analysis is now a formal requirement for submissions
to top cybersecurity research venues. This requirement reflects a growing
consensus that cybersecurity researchers must go beyond providing capabilities
to anticipating and mitigating the potential harms thereof. However, many
cybersecurity researchers may be uncertain about how to proceed in an ethics
analysis. In this guide, we provide practical support for that requirement by
enumerating stakeholder types and mapping them to common empirical research
methods. We also offer worked examples to demonstrate how researchers can
identify likely stakeholder exposures in real-world projects. Our goal is to
help research teams meet new ethics mandates with confidence and clarity, not
confusion.

Abstract: The integration of information and communication technology (ICT) with
traditional power grids has led to the emergence of smart grids. Advanced
metering infrastructure (AMI) plays a crucial role in smart grids by
facilitating two-way communication between smart meters and the utility
provider. This bidirectional communication allows intelligent meters to report
fine-grained consumption data at predefined intervals, enabling accurate
billing, efficient grid monitoring and management, and rapid outage detection.
However, the collection of detailed consumption data can inadvertently disclose
consumers' daily activities, raising privacy concerns and potentially leading
to privacy violations. To address these issues and preserve individuals'
privacy, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving smart metering protocol
specifically designed to support real-time tariff billing service with dynamic
policy adjustment. Our scheme employs an efficient data perturbation technique
to obscure precise energy usage data from internal adversaries, including the
intermediary gateways and the utility provider. Subsequently, we validate the
efficiency and security of our protocol through comprehensive performance and
privacy evaluations. We examined the computational, memory, and communication
overhead of the proposed scheme. The execution time of our secure and
privacy-aware billing system is approximately 3.94540 seconds for a complete
year. Furthermore, we employed the Jensen-Shannon divergence as a privacy
metric to demonstrate that our protocol can effectively safeguard users'
privacy by increasing the noise scale.

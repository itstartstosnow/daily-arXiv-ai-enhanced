By comparing inertial measurement and CAN data during significant vehicle events, the method accurately identified the CAN channels associated with the accelerator pedal, brake pedal, and steering wheel. Utilizing an IMU, CAN module, and event-driven software architecture, the system was validated using prerecorded serialized data from previous studies. This data, collected during multiple vehicle drives, included synchronized IMU and CAN recordings. By using these consistent datasets, the improvements made in this work were tested and validated under the same conditions as in the previous studies, enabling direct comparison to earlier results. Faster processing times were produced and less computational power was needed, as compared to the earlier methods. This work could have potential application to making aftermarket autonomous vehicle kits and for cybersecurity applications. It is a scalable and adaptable solution for autonomous CAN reverse engineering in near real-time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f66\u8f86CAN\u603b\u7ebf\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u8f66\u8f86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u548cCAN\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u52a0\u901f\u8e0f\u677f\u3001\u5239\u8f66\u8e0f\u677f\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u76d8\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684CAN\u901a\u9053\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f66\u8f86CAN\u603b\u7ebf\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u552e\u540e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5957\u4ef6\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528IMU\u548cCAN\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u8f66\u8f86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548cCAN\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u63a7\u5236\u90e8\u4ef6\u7684CAN\u901a\u9053\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9884\u5f55\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u8e0f\u677f\u3001\u5239\u8f66\u8e0f\u677f\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u76d8\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684CAN\u901a\u9053\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7ed3\u679c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aCAN\u603b\u7ebf\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u552e\u540e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5957\u4ef6\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on \"triggering cues\": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce \"intent laundering\": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues. In fact, once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated \"reasonably safe\" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access.

Prior work shows that adversarial prompt manipulation can degrade large language model (LLM) performance in code generation. We test whether similar comment-based manipulation misleads LLMs during vulnerability detection. We build a 100-sample benchmark across Python, JavaScript, and Java, each paired with eight comment variants ranging from no comments to adversarial strategies such as authority spoofing and technical deception. Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p > 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero). This holds for commercial models with 89 to 96 percent baseline detection and open-source models with 53 to 72 percent, despite large absolute performance gaps. Unlike generation settings where comment manipulation achieves high attack success, detection performance does not meaningfully degrade. More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total).

Recent research has however showed that simple prompt injections embedded within a candidate document (i.e., jailbreak prompt attacks) can significantly alter an LLM's ranking decisions. While this poses serious security risks to LLM-based ranking pipelines, the extent to which this vulnerability persists across diverse LLM families, architectures, and settings remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study of jailbreak prompt attacks against LLM rankers. We focus our evaluation on two complementary tasks: (1) Preference Vulnerability Assessment, measuring intrinsic susceptibility via attack success rate (ASR); and (2) Ranking Vulnerability Assessment, quantifying the operational impact on the ranking's quality (nDCG@10). We systematically examine three prevalent ranking paradigms (pairwise, listwise, setwise) under two injection variants: decision objective hijacking and decision criteria hijacking. Beyond reproducing prior findings, we expand the analysis to cover vulnerability scaling across model families, position sensitivity, backbone architectures, and cross-domain robustness. Our results characterize the boundary conditions of these vulnerabilities, revealing critical insights such as that encoder-decoder architectures exhibit strong inherent resilience to jailbreak attacks.

With minimal test cases of information and access security, NESSiE reveals safety-relevant failures that should not exist, given the low complexity of the tasks. NESSiE is intended as a lightweight, easy-to-use sanity check for language model safety and, as such, is not sufficient for guaranteeing safety in general -- but we argue that passing this test is necessary for any deployment. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs do not reach 100% on NESSiE and thus fail our necessary condition of language model safety, even in the absence of adversarial attacks. Our Safe & Helpful (SH) metric allows for direct comparison of the two requirements, showing models are biased toward being helpful rather than safe.

Our system addresses the unique challenges of autoregressive LLM decoding over high-latency wide-area networks (WANs), contributing: (1) an asymmetric layer split where embedding and unembedding layers remain local, ensuring raw tokens never leave the trusted device; (2) the first application of lookahead decoding to split inference over WANs, amortizing network round-trip latency across multiple tokens per iteration; (3) an empirical inversion attack evaluation showing that split depth provides a tunable privacy-performance tradeoff -- an attacker can recover ~59%% of tokens at a 2-layer split but only ~35%% at an 8-layer split, with minimal throughput impact; (4) ablation experiments showing that n-gram speculation accepts 1.2-1.3 tokens per decoding step on average (peak of 7 observed on code), with acceptance rates consistent across model scales; (5) formal verification that lookahead decoding produces token-identical output to sequential decoding under greedy argmax, with zero quality degradation; and (6) scaling validation on Mistral NeMo 12B (40 layers), demonstrating that the system generalizes to larger models with only 4.9 GB local VRAM and matching 7B throughput.

We then design attacks for the closed-world setting. Given two databases of pseudonymous individuals, each containing unstructured text written by or about that individual, we implement a scalable attack pipeline that uses LLMs to: (1) extract identity-relevant features, (2) search for candidate matches via semantic embeddings, and (3) reason over top candidates to verify matches and reduce false positives. Compared to prior deanonymization work (e.g., on the Netflix prize) that required structured data or manual feature engineering, our approach works directly on raw user content across arbitrary platforms. We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched. In each setting, LLM-based methods substantially outperform classical baselines, achieving up to 68% recall at 90% precision compared to near 0% for the best non-LLM method.

Yet, existing approaches often rely on heavyweight fine-tuning that is costly to update, audit, and maintain across model families. Full fine-tuning incurs substantial computational and storage overhead, while parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA trade efficiency for inconsistent safety gains and sensitivity to design choices. Safety intervention mechanisms such as circuit breakers reduce unsafe outputs without modifying model weights, but do not directly shape or preserve the internal representations that govern safety behavior. These limitations hinder rapid and reliable safety updates, particularly in settings where models evolve frequently or must adapt to new policies and domains.\n  We present NeST, a lightweight, structure-aware safety alignment framework that strengthens refusal behavior by selectively adapting a small subset of safety-relevant neurons while freezing the remainder of the model. NeST aligns parameter updates with the internal organization of safety behavior by clustering functionally coherent safety neurons and enforcing shared updates within each cluster, enabling targeted and stable safety adaptation without broad model modification or inference-time overhead. We benchmark NeST against three dominant baselines: full fine-tuning, LoRA-based fine-tuning, and circuit breakers across 10 open-weight LLMs spanning multiple model families and sizes. Across all evaluated models, NeST reduces the attack success rate from an average of 44.5% to 4.36%, corresponding to a 90.2% reduction in unsafe generations, while requiring only 0.44 million trainable parameters on average.

This has led to increased use of third-party hosting services. However, in this setting, there is a lack of guarantees on the computation performed by the inference provider. For example, a dishonest provider may replace an expensive large model with a cheaper-to-run weaker model and return the results from the weaker model to the user. Existing tools to verify inference typically rely on methods from cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), but these add significant computational overhead, and remain infeasible for use for large models. In this work, we develop a new insight -- that given a method for performing private LLM inference, one can obtain forms of verified inference at marginal extra cost. Specifically, we propose two new protocols which leverage privacy-preserving LLM inference in order to provide guarantees over the inference that was carried out. Our approaches are cheap, requiring the addition of a few extra tokens of computation, and have little to no downstream impact. As the fastest privacy-preserving inference methods are typically faster than ZK methods, the proposed protocols also improve verification runtime.

Unlike disembodied AI, failures in embodied intelligence lead to irreversible physical consequences, raising fundamental questions about security, safety, and reliability. While existing research predominantly analyzes embodied AI through the lenses of Large Language Model (LLM) vulnerabilities or classical Cyber-Physical System (CPS) failures, this survey argues that these perspectives are individually insufficient to explain many observed breakdowns in modern embodied systems. We posit that a significant class of failures arises from embodiment-induced system-level mismatches, rather than from isolated model flaws or traditional CPS attacks. Specifically, we identify four core insights that explain why embodied AI is fundamentally harder to secure: (i) semantic correctness does not imply physical safety, as language-level reasoning abstracts away geometry, dynamics, and contact constraints; (ii) identical actions can lead to drastically different outcomes across physical states due to nonlinear dynamics and state uncertainty; (iii) small errors propagate and amplify across tightly coupled perception-decision-action loops; and (iv) safety is not compositional across time or system layers, enabling locally safe decisions to accumulate into globally unsafe behavior. These insights suggest that securing embodied AI requires moving beyond component-level defenses toward system-level reasoning about physical risk, uncertainty, and failure propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5177\u8eabAI\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u8eabAI\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u6e90\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6027\u96be\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6b63\u4ece\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u5411\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5176\u5931\u8d25\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u7269\u7406\u540e\u679c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4eceLLM\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6216\u4f20\u7edfCPS\u6545\u969c\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u89d2\u5355\u72ec\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u73b0\u4ee3\u5177\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u6545\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u89c1\u89e3\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5177\u8eabAI\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u66f4\u96be\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff1a(1)\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u7269\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff1b(2)\u76f8\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b(3)\u5c0f\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u51b3\u7b56-\u884c\u52a8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\u653e\u5927\uff1b(4)\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6216\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fdd\u969c\u5177\u8eabAI\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u7269\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6545\u969c\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

When only parts of a document are sensitive, providers who want to avoid leaking protected information typically must manually redact documents before sharing them, which is costly, coarse-grained, and hard to maintain as policies or partners change. We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer. Our contribution is primarily architectural: we do not yet implement or empirically evaluate the full enforcement pipeline. We therefore outline an evaluation methodology to assess security, utility, and performance trade-offs under benign and adversarial querying as a basis for future empirical work on systematically governed LLM access to multi-party data spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAVE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u6267\u884c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u7684\u865a\u62df\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ea7\u522b\u6267\u884c\uff1a\u6574\u4e2a\u6587\u6863\u8981\u4e48\u5171\u4eab\u8981\u4e48\u4fdd\u7559\u3002\u5f53\u6587\u6863\u53ea\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u5185\u5bb9\u654f\u611f\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c97\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u968f\u7b56\u7565\u6216\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAVE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u56de\u7b54\u79c1\u6709\u6587\u6863\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u865a\u62df\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6e90\u6587\u6863\u3002\u67b6\u6784\u96c6\u6210Eclipse Dataspace Components\u548cODRL\u98ce\u683c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7aef\u96c6\u6210\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u5c1a\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6216\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7528\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "DAVE\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u591a\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u7684LLM\u8bbf\u95ee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u865a\u62df\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u624b\u52a8\u6587\u6863\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines), which emulate CPU instruction execution, Jolt Atlas adapts Jolt's lookup-centric approach and applies it directly to ONNX tensor operations. The ONNX computational model eliminates the need for CPU registers and simplifies memory consistency verification. In addition, ONNX is an open-source, portable format, which makes it easy to share and deploy models across different frameworks, hardware platforms, and runtime environments without requiring framework-specific conversions.\n  Our lookup arguments, which use sumcheck protocol, are well-suited for non-linear functions -- key building blocks in modern ML. We apply optimisations such as neural teleportation to reduce the size of lookup tables while preserving model accuracy, as well as several tensor-level verification optimisations detailed in this paper. We demonstrate that Jolt Atlas can prove model inference in memory-constrained environments -- a prover property commonly referred to as \\textit{streaming}. Furthermore, we discuss how Jolt Atlas achieves zero-knowledge through the BlindFold technique, as introduced in Vega. In contrast to existing zkML frameworks, we show practical proving times for classification, embedding, automated reasoning, and small language models.\n  Jolt Atlas enables cryptographic verification that can be run on-device, without specialised hardware. The resulting proofs are succinctly verifiable. This makes Jolt Atlas well-suited for privacy-centric and adversarial environments.

Existing verification methods are often impractical: formal tools are too restrictive, while black-box statistical auditing is intractable for complex pipelines and fails to pinpoint the source of the bug. This paper introduces Re:cord-play, a gray-box auditing paradigm that inspects the internal state of DP algorithms. By running an instrumented algorithm on neighboring datasets with identical randomness, Re:cord-play directly checks for data-dependent control flow and provides concrete falsification of sensitivity violations by comparing declared sensitivity against the empirically measured distance between internal inputs. We generalize this to Re:cord-play-sample, a full statistical audit that isolates and tests each component, including untrusted ones. We show that our novel testing approach is both effective and necessary by auditing 12 open-source libraries, including SmartNoise SDK, Opacus, and Diffprivlib, and uncovering 13 privacy violations that impact their theoretical guarantees.

In this paper, we present a large-scale automated analysis of open-source CTI reports spanning two decades. We develop a high-precision, LLM-based pipeline to ingest and structure 13,308 reports, extracting key entities such as attributed threat actors, motivations, victims, reporting vendors, and technical indicators (IoCs and TTPs). Our analysis quantifies the evolution of CTI information density and specialization, characterizing patterns that relate specific threat actors to motivations and victim profiles. Furthermore, we perform a meta-analysis of the CTI industry itself. We identify a fragmented ecosystem of distinct silos where vendors demonstrate significant geographic and sectoral reporting biases. Our marginal coverage analysis reveals that intelligence overlap between vendors is typically low: while a few core providers may offer broad situational awareness, additional sources yield diminishing returns. Overall, our findings characterize the structural biases inherent in the CTI ecosystem, enabling practitioners and researchers to better evaluate the completeness of their intelligence sources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u679020\u5e74\u6765\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u60c5\u62a5\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5a01\u80c1\u60c5\u62a5\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u62a5\u544a\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f00\u6e90\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u60c5\u62a5\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u5a01\u80c1\u884c\u4e3a\u8005-\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u96f6\u6563\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5904\u740613,308\u4efd\u5f00\u6e90CTI\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u5b9e\u4f53\uff08\u5a01\u80c1\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u3001\u52a8\u673a\u3001\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u3001\u62a5\u544a\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u3001\u6280\u672f\u6307\u6807\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5316\u4e86CTI\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5a01\u80c1\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u4e0e\u52a8\u673a\u3001\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CTI\u884c\u4e1a\u5b58\u5728\u5730\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u62a5\u544a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u95f4\u60c5\u62a5\u91cd\u53e0\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86CTI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u60c5\u62a5\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u62a5\u544a\u504f\u5dee\u5bf9\u5a01\u80c1\u60c5\u62a5\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose the Boltzmann Draw that is a probabilistic algorithm inspired by the principles of statistical physics. The algorithm relies on drawing tokens according to the Boltzmann distribution, serving as an extension and improvement of the Random Draw method. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in bounding the number of selected input tokens as well as reducing dust generation and limiting the token pool size in the wallet. Moreover, the probabilistic algorithm can be implemented efficiently, improves performance and respects privacy requirements - properties of significant relevance for current token-based technologies. We compare the Boltzmann draw to both the standard Random Draw and the Greedy algorithm. We argue that the former is superior to the latter in the sense of the above objectives. Our findings are relevant for token-based technologies, and are also of interest for CBDCs, which as a legal tender possibly needs to handle large transaction volumes at a high frequency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBoltzmann Draw\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6027\u786c\u5e01\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u548cCBDC\u7b49\u4ee3\u5e01\u652f\u4ed8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u8d44\u91d1\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4ee3\u5e01\u652f\u4ed8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u3001\u592e\u884c\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u786c\u5e01\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u6d89\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u7ec4\u4ee3\u5e01\u6765\u4e3a\u4ea4\u6613\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d44\u91d1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u4ee3\u5e01\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u7c89\u5c18\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9650\u5236\u94b1\u5305\u4ee3\u5e01\u6c60\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5e76\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBoltzmann Draw\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u62bd\u53d6\u4ee3\u5e01\uff0c\u662f\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9650\u5236\u6240\u9009\u8f93\u5165\u4ee3\u5e01\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7c89\u5c18\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u94b1\u5305\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u5e01\u6c60\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u53d6\u548c\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cBoltzmann Draw\u5728\u4ee5\u4e0a\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "Boltzmann Draw\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4ee3\u5e01\u652f\u4ed8\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u786c\u5e01\u9009\u62e9\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u9891\u5927\u4ea4\u6613\u91cf\u7684\u592e\u884c\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u5e01\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We analyze 28 LLM-based penetration testing systems and evaluate five representative implementations across three benchmarks of increasing complexity. Our analysis reveals two distinct failure modes: Type A failures stem from capability gaps (missing tools, inadequate prompts) that engineering readily addresses, while Type B failures persist regardless of tooling due to planning and state management limitations. We show that Type B failures share a root cause that is largely invariant to the underlying LLM: agents lack real-time task difficulty estimation. As a result, agents misallocate effort, over-commit to low-value branches, and exhaust context before completing attack chains.\n  Based on this insight, we present Excalibur, a penetration testing agent that couples strong tooling with difficulty-aware planning. A Tool and Skill Layer eliminates Type A failures through typed interfaces and retrieval-augmented knowledge. A Task Difficulty Assessment (TDA) mechanism addresses Type B failures by estimating tractability through four measurable dimensions (horizon estimation, evidence confidence, context load, and historical success) and uses these estimates to guide exploration-exploitation decisions within an Evidence-Guided Attack Tree Search (EGATS) framework. Excalibur achieves up to 91% task completion on CTF benchmarks with frontier models (39 to 49% relative improvement over baselines) and compromises 4 of 5 hosts on the GOAD Active Directory environment versus 2 by prior systems. These results show that difficulty-aware planning yields consistent end-to-end gains across models and addresses a limitation that model scaling alone does not eliminate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e8628\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1aType A\uff08\u5de5\u5177/\u63d0\u793a\u4e0d\u8db3\uff09\u548cType B\uff08\u89c4\u5212/\u72b6\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\uff09\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faExcalibur\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u6280\u80fd\u5c42\u89e3\u51b3Type A\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3Type B\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u90a3\u4e9b\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u5de5\u7a0b\u6539\u8fdb\u5c31\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u5206\u679028\u4e2aLLM\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f305\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b2) \u8bc6\u522bType A\uff08\u80fd\u529b\u7f3a\u9677\uff09\u548cType B\uff08\u89c4\u5212\u9650\u5236\uff09\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51faExcalibur\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u5305\u542b\u5de5\u5177\u6280\u80fd\u5c42\uff08\u89e3\u51b3Type A\uff09\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff08\u89e3\u51b3Type B\uff09\uff1b4) \u4f7f\u7528\u8bc1\u636e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "Excalibur\u5728CTF\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523091%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534739-49%\uff09\uff0c\u5728GOAD Active Directory\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u653b\u96774/5\u4e2a\u4e3b\u673a\uff08\u5148\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec52\u4e2a\uff09\u3002\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u90fd\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dType B\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002Excalibur\u901a\u8fc7\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

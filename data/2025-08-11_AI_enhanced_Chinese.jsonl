Our implementation achieves 15-second domain\nrecord propagation times, supports 20 standard DNS record types, and provides\nperpetual free .ddns domains. The system has been deployed across distributed\ninfrastructure in San Jose, Los Angeles, and Orange County, demonstrating\npractical scalability and resistance to traditional DNS manipulation\ntechniques. Performance evaluation shows the system can handle up to Max Theor.\nTPS 1,111.1 tx/s (minimal transactions) and Max Theor.

However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as\ndatabase intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise.\nInternal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it\neasier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external\nmasqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the\norganization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect\nanomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences\nof operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent\nnormal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble\nnormal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to\nidentify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for\nStructured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient,\npre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised\nmachine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while\nminimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses\nensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned\nnormal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope\nqueries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based\nmodels to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using\nrole-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings\nmake a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for\nsafeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDistilBERT\u7684\u4e24\u5c42\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522bSQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5f02\u5e38\u8bbf\u95ee\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8bef\u5224\u6216\u6f0f\u5224\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6807\u8bb0\u5f02\u5e38\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5fae\u8c03Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff08DistilBERT\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5185\u90e8\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u5173\u952e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u514d\u53d7\u590d\u6742\u5a01\u80c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Instead of relying on speculative\nbeliefs, it frames the asset's price within a Rational-Expectations\nSecurity-Utility Nash Equilibrium (RESUNE). This equilibrium is a fixed point\nwhere the market-clearing price dictates the hash rate through a free-entry\nmining model, which in turn endogenously sets the network's security. The\nsecurity, defined as one minus the probability of a 51% attack, is determined\nvia a global games model of attacker coordination, providing a unique and\ncontinuous security function. We prove the existence of a RESUNE and offer\nconditions for its uniqueness and stability. The model predicts that the\nstabilizing direct effect of price on demand must outweigh the potentially\ndestabilizing feedback from price to security. The framework generates testable\npredictions, such as a protocol halving causing a contraction in both hash rate\nand price. A structural Vector Autoregression (VAR) model is proposed to test\nthis mechanism.

These attacks easily bypass existing\ndefenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To\naddress this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided\nCoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based\non two key insights. First, to counteract the model's oversensitivity to\ntriggers, we propose a Key-extraction-guided Chain-of-Thought (KCoT). Instead\nof only considering the single trigger or the input sentence, KCoT prompts the\nagent to extract task-relevant key phrases. Second, to guide the LLM toward\ncorrect answers, our proposed Soft Label Mechanism (SLM) prompts the agent to\nquantify the semantic correlation between key phrases and candidate answers.\nCrucially, to mitigate the influence of residual triggers or misleading content\nin phrases extracted by KCoT, which typically causes anomalous scores, SLM\nexcludes anomalous scores deviating significantly from the mean and\nsubsequently averages the remaining scores to derive a more reliable semantic\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments on classification and question-answer\n(QA) tasks demonstrate that SLIP is highly effective, reducing the average\nattack success rate (ASR) from 90.2% to 25.13% while maintaining high accuracy\non clean data and outperforming state-of-the-art defenses.

In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols\nand develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and\nsimulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable\nto incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller\nprofitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we\nintroduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both\nNakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical\nperspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction\nconflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair\ndistribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use\nstate-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and\nconsider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about\nthe resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u884cPoW\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6295\u7968\u534a\u5e76\u884cPoW\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eNakamoto\u5171\u8bc6\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u884cPoW\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u884cPoW\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdbNakamoto\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u884cPoW\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6295\u7968\u534a\u5e76\u884cPoW\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MDP\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u884cPoW\u534f\u8bae\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6fc0\u52b1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u6fc0\u52b1\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u8d39\u7528\u5206\u914d\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6295\u7968\u534a\u5e76\u884cPoW\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Manual investigation of such a vast\namount of malware is an unrealistic, time-consuming, and overwhelming task. To\ncope with this volume, there is a clear need to develop specialized techniques\nand efficient tools for preliminary filtering that can group malware based on\nsemantic similarity. In this paper, we propose TrapNet, a novel, scalable, and\nunsupervised framework for malware fingerprinting and grouping. TrapNet employs\ngraph community detection techniques for malware fingerprinting and family\nattribution based on static analysis, as follows: (1) TrapNet detects packed\nbinaries and unpacks them using known generic packer tools. (2) From each\nmalware sample, it generates a digest that captures the underlying semantics.\nSince the digest must be dense, efficient, and suitable for similarity\nchecking, we designed FloatHash (FH), a novel numerical fuzzy hashing technique\nthat produces a short real-valued vector summarizing the underlying assembly\nitems and their order. FH is based on applying Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) to ordered assembly items (e.g., opcodes, function calls) extracted from\nthe malware's assembly code. (3) Representing malware with short numerical\nvectors enables high-performance, large-scale similarity computation, which\nallows TrapNet to build a malware similarity network. (4) Finally, TrapNet\nemploys state-of-the-art community detection algorithms to identify dense\ncommunities, which represent groups of malware with similar semantics. Our\nextensive evaluation of TrapNet demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of the\ncoverage and purity of the detected communities, while also highlighting its\nruntime efficiency, which outperforms other state-of-the-art solutions."}

Watermarking offers a promising solution: model owners can embed an\nimperceptible signal into generated text, marking its origin. Most leading\napproaches seed an LLM's next-token sampling with a pseudo-random key that can\nlater be recovered to identify the text as machine-generated, while only\nminimally altering the model's output distribution.

To address these issues, we\nintroduce SimKey, a semantic key module that strengthens watermark robustness\nby tying key generation to the meaning of prior context.

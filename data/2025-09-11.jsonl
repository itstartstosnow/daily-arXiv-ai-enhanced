The\nprimary attack vectors for supply chain attacks are through: (1) software\ncomponents; (2) the build infrastructure; and (3) humans (a.k.a software\npractitioners). Software supply chain risk management frameworks provide a list\nof tasks that an organization can adopt to reduce software supply chain risk.\nExhaustively adopting all the tasks of these frameworks is infeasible,\nnecessitating the prioritized adoption of tasks. Software organizations can\nbenefit from being guided in this prioritization by learning what tasks other\nteams have adopted. The goal of this study is to aid software development\norganizations in understanding the adoption of security tasks that reduce\nsoftware supply chain risk through an interview study of software practitioners\nengaged in software supply chain risk management efforts. An interview study\nwas conducted with 61 practitioners at nine software development organizations\nthat have focused efforts on reducing software supply chain risk. The results\nof the interviews indicate that organizations had implemented the most adopted\nsoftware tasks before the focus on software supply chain security. Therefore,\ntheir implementation in organizations is more mature. The tasks that mitigate\nthe novel attack vectors through software components and the build\ninfrastructure are in the early stages of adoption. Adoption of these tasks\nshould be prioritized."}

However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where\nByzantine clients compromise the integrity of the global model by submitting\nmalicious updates. Robust aggregation methods have been widely adopted to\nmitigate such threats, relying on the core assumption that malicious updates\nare inherently out-of-distribution and can therefore be identified and excluded\nbefore aggregating client updates. In this paper, we challenge this underlying\nassumption by showing that a model can be poisoned while keeping malicious\nupdates within the main distribution. We propose Chameleon Poisoning (CHAMP),\nan adaptive and evasive poisoning strategy that exploits side-channel feedback\nfrom the aggregation process to guide the attack. Specifically, the adversary\ncontinuously infers whether its malicious contribution has been incorporated\ninto the global model and adapts accordingly. This enables a dynamic adjustment\nof the local loss function, balancing a malicious component with a camouflaging\ncomponent, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the poisoning while evading\nrobust aggregation defenses. CHAMP enables more effective and evasive\npoisoning, highlighting a fundamental limitation of existing robust aggregation\ndefenses and underscoring the need for new strategies to secure federated\nlearning against sophisticated adversaries. Our approach is evaluated in two\ndatasets reaching an average increase of 47.07% in attack success rate against\nnine robust aggregation defenses."}

In\nthis paper, targeting the semi-structured sparsity, we introduce a Silent Until\nSparse (SUS) backdoor attack, where the released full model remains silent\n(benign), but becomes a backdoored model after sparsification. The attack\noperates in two phases: (i) in the backdoor training phase, the backdoor\nfunctionality is injected into specific weights that will be retained during\nthe pruning process; (ii) in the backdoor hiding phase, the malicious behavior\nis concealed by fine-tuning elements that will be pruned away. This dual-phase\napproach ensures that the attack remains undetectable in the released model,\nbut activates properly once the model is pruned with the semi-structured\nsparsity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our attack successfully\nthreatens the semi-structured sparsity algorithms from both NVIDIA and PyTorch.\nOur empirical results show that, regardless of model architecture, the attack\nsuccess rate of the released model remains below 10% prior to sparsification\nbut exceeds 99% afterward. Moreover, we demonstrate that SUS attack is robust\nagainst state-of-the-art backdoor defenses and finetuning, highlighting a\ncritical vulnerability in current model compression and deployment pipelines."}

Training a benign model from a dataset\npoisoned by backdoor attacks is challenging. Existing works rely on various\nassumptions and can only defend against backdoor attacks with specific trigger\nsignals, high poisoning ratios, or when the defender possesses a large,\nuntainted, validation dataset. In this paper, we propose a defense called\nPrototype-Guided Robust Learning (PGRL), which overcomes all the aforementioned\nlimitations, being robust against diverse backdoor attacks. Leveraging a tiny\nset of benign samples, PGRL generates prototype vectors to guide the training\nprocess. We compare our PGRL with 8 existing defenses, showing that it achieves\nsuperior robustness. We also demonstrate that PGRL generalizes well across\nvarious architectures, datasets, and advanced attacks. Finally, to evaluate our\nPGRL in the worst-case scenario, we perform an adaptive attack, where the\nattackers fully know the details of the defense."}

So far, no sound, fully static noninterference\nanalysis for Wasm has been presented, but sound reachability analyses were.\nThis work presents a novel and general approach to lift reachability analyses\nto noninterference by tracking taints on values and using value-sensitive,\nrelational reasoning to remove them when appropriate.

We establish that verifying\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy for these programs is \\emph{almost\ndecidable}, meaning the problem is decidable for all values of $\\delta$ except\nthose in a finite set.

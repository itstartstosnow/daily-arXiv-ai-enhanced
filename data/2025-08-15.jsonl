FL offers formal security guarantees when\ncombined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,\nhowever, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical\nutility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often\npresent in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these\ninterconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL\nframework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial\nexperiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,\nresulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first\nintegrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek\nLinks (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically\nuseful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using\na tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear\ntrade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the\noptimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal\noperational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong\nprivacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high\nclinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a\npractical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate\ndiagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare\ndata."}

However, recent studies have shown that\nthese systems are vulnerable to graph manipulation attacks, where attackers\nmanipulate the graph structure to evade detection. While some previous\napproaches have discussed this type of attack, none have fully addressed it\nwith a robust detection solution, limiting the practical applicability of\nPIDSes.\n  To address this challenge, we propose MirGuard, a robust anomaly detection\nframework that combines logic-aware multi-view augmentation with contrastive\nrepresentation learning. Rather than applying arbitrary structural\nperturbations, MirGuard introduces Logic-Aware Noise Injection (LNI) to\ngenerate semantically valid graph views, ensuring that all augmentations\npreserve the underlying causal semantics of the provenance data. These views\nare then used in a Logic-Preserving Contrastive Learning framework, which\nencourages the model to learn representations that are invariant to benign\ntransformations but sensitive to adversarial inconsistencies. Comprehensive\nevaluations on multiple provenance datasets demonstrate that MirGuard\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in robustness against\nvarious graph manipulation attacks without sacrificing detection performance\nand efficiency. Our work represents the first targeted study to enhance PIDS\nagainst such adversarial threats, providing a robust and effective solution to\nmodern cybersecurity challenges."}

This research\naddresses these challenges by integrating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to\nenhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of malware detection models.\nIn this research, the use of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for dynamic malware\nanalysis has been considered, a less explored area, and its efficacy in\ndetecting Metamorphic Malware, and further the effectiveness and transparency\nof MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and CNN-LSTM models in malware classification, evaluating\nthese models through the lens of Explainable AI (XAI).

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically\nretrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that\ncombines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with\nstandardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware\nenrichment of security alerts. The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by\nan LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise,\nactionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies. We\npropose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an\nauxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts.\nEmpirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our\napproach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR,\nalleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency.

These dynamic\ndialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy\nviolations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and\ndiscover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we\npresent a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and\ndefender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each\nsimulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.\nWhile the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)\nattempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)\nthrough persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space\nefficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel\nsearch with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation\ntrajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we\nfind that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to\nsophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,\nwhile defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification\nstate machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse\nscenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for\nbuilding privacy-aware agents."}

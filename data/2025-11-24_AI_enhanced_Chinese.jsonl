However, existing methods often rely on manually crafted triggers and static data pipelines, which are rigid, labor-intensive, and inadequate for systematically evaluating modern defense robustness. As AI agents become increasingly capable, there is a growing need for more rigorous, diverse, and scalable \\textit{red-teaming frameworks} that can realistically simulate backdoor threats and assess model resilience under adversarial conditions. In this work, we introduce \\textsc{AutoBackdoor}, a general framework for automating backdoor injection, encompassing trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning via an autonomous agent-driven pipeline. Unlike prior approaches, AutoBackdoor uses a powerful language model agent to generate semantically coherent, context-aware trigger phrases, enabling scalable poisoning across arbitrary topics with minimal human effort. We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \\textit{Bias Recommendation}, \\textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \\textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples. More importantly, we find that existing defenses often fail to mitigate these attacks, underscoring the need for more rigorous and adaptive evaluation techniques against agent-driven threats as explored in this work.

This task is complicated by the need to analyze the intricate coupling between complex software behavior and the system's physical dynamics. Furthermore, the periodic execution of control code in CPS applications creates a combinatorial explosion of execution paths that must be analyzed over time, far exceeding the scope of traditional single-run code analysis.\n  This paper introduces RampoNN, a novel framework that systematically identifies kinetic vulnerabilities given the control code, a physical system model, and a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specification of safe behavior. RampoNN first analyzes the control code to map the control signals that can be generated under various execution branches. It then employs a neural network to abstract the physical system's behavior. To overcome the poor scaling and loose over-approximations of standard neural network reachability, RampoNN uniquely utilizes Deep Bernstein neural networks, which are equipped with customized reachability algorithms that yield orders of magnitude tighter bounds. This high-precision reachability analysis allows RampoNN to rapidly prune large sets of guaranteed-safe behaviors and rank the remaining traces by their potential to violate the specification. The results of this analysis are then used to effectively guide a falsification engine, focusing its search on the most promising system behaviors to find actual vulnerabilities.\n  We evaluated our approach on a PLC-controlled water tank system and a switched PID controller for an automotive engine. The results demonstrate that RampoNN leads to acceleration of the process of finding kinetic vulnerabilities by up to 98.27% and superior scalability compared to other state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "RampoNN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u3001\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2f\u6069\u65af\u5766\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f0f\u6d1e\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u8f6f\u4ef6\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6267\u884c\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "RampoNN\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee5\u6620\u5c04\u5404\u79cd\u6267\u884c\u5206\u652f\u4e0b\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2f\u6069\u65af\u5766\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u62bd\u8c61\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5f15\u5bfc\u53cd\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u5f15\u64ce\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6700\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6c34\u7bb1\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6c7d\u8f66\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cRampoNN\u5c06\u53d1\u73b0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe98.27%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RampoNN\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

These attacks may pose significant privacy risks to individuals whose sensitive data were used for training, which motivates the use of defenses such as differential privacy, often at the cost of high accuracy losses. MIAs exploit the differences in the behavior of a model when making predictions on samples it has seen during training (members) versus those it has not seen (non-members). Several studies have pointed out that model overfitting is the major factor contributing to these differences in behavior and, consequently, to the success of MIAs. However, the literature also shows that even non-overfitted ML models can leak information about a small subset of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the root causes of membership inference vulnerabilities beyond traditional overfitting concerns and suggest targeted defenses. We empirically analyze the characteristics of the training data samples vulnerable to MIAs in models that are not overfitted (and hence able to generalize).

In most of these approaches, hardware extensions such as Intel SGX, TDX, AMD SEV, etc., are leveraged to provide encryption and integrity protection on process or VM level. Although all of these approaches increase the trust in the application at runtime, an often overlooked aspect is the integrity and confidentiality protection at build time, which is equally important as maliciously injected code during compilation can compromise the entire application and system. In this paper, we present Tical, a practical framework for trusted compilation that provides integrity protection and confidentiality in build pipelines from source code to the final executable. Our approach harnesses TEEs as runtime protection but enriches TEEs with file system shielding and an immutable audit log with version history to provide accountability. This way, we can ensure that the compiler chain can only access trusted files and intermediate output, such as object files produced by trusted processes. Our evaluation using micro- and macro-benchmarks shows that Tical can protect the confidentiality and integrity of whole CI/CD pipelines with an acceptable performance overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tical\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u7f16\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528TEEs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c4f\u853d\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65e5\u5fd7\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u94fe\u53ea\u80fd\u8bbf\u95ee\u53ef\u4fe1\u6587\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4f46\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f16\u8bd1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6076\u610f\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u80fd\u5371\u53ca\u6574\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528TEEs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c4f\u853d\u548c\u5e26\u6709\u7248\u672c\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u94fe\u53ea\u80fd\u8bbf\u95ee\u7531\u53ef\u4fe1\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6587\u4ef6\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b8f\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cTical\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u4fdd\u62a4\u6574\u4e2aCI/CD\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7684\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Tical\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u7f16\u8bd1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

While extensive research has explored the use of supervised Machine Learning for attack detection and characterisation, these methods require accurately labelled datasets, which are very costly to obtain. Moreover, existing public datasets have limited and/or outdated attacks, and many of them suffer from mislabelled data. To reduce the reliance on labelled data, we propose AutoGraphAD, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder. AutoGraphAD operates on heterogeneous graphs, made from connection and IP nodes that capture network activity within a time window. The model is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, without relying on any labelled data. The reconstruction, structural loss, and KL divergence are then weighted and combined in an anomaly score that is then used for anomaly detection. Overall, AutoGraphAD yields the same, and in some cases better, results than previous unsupervised approaches, such as Anomal-E, but without requiring costly downstream anomaly detectors. As a result, AutoGraphAD achieves around 1.18 orders of magnitude faster training and 1.03 orders of magnitude faster inference, which represents a significant advantage for operational deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoGraphAD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u53d8\u5206\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u6709\u9650\u3001\u8fc7\u65f6\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u8bb0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u53d8\u5206\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u8fde\u63a5\u548cIP\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u6784\u635f\u5931\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u635f\u5931\u548cKL\u6563\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570", "result": "AutoGraphAD\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u7ea61.18\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u7ea61.03\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u662f\u7f51\u7edc\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Preprint on cryptographic evidence and compliance for regulated AI workflows", "summary": "This paper introduces constant-size cryptographic evidence structures, a general abstraction for representing verifiable audit evidence for AI workflows in regulated environments. Each evidence item is a fixed-size tuple of cryptographic fields, designed to (i) provide strong binding to workflow events and configurations, (ii) support constant-size storage and uniform verification cost per event, and (iii) compose cleanly with hash-chain and Merkle-based audit constructions. We formalize a simple model of regulated AI workflows, define syntax and algorithms for evidence structures, and articulate security goals such as audit integrity and non-equivocation. We present a generic hash-and-sign construction that instantiates this abstraction using a collision-resistant hash function and a standard digital signature scheme. We then show how to integrate the construction with hash-chained logs, Merkle-tree anchoring, and optionally trusted execution environments, and we analyze the asymptotic complexity of evidence generation and verification. Finally, we implement a prototype library and report microbenchmark results on commodity hardware, demonstrating that the per-event overhead of constant-size evidence is small and predictable.

We exploit this as an attack surface via Sensitivity-Scaled Steering (SSS), a progressive activation-level attack that combines beginning-of-sequence (BOS) anchoring with sensitivity-based reinforcement to focus a limited perturbation budget on the most vulnerable layers and tokens. We show that across multiple open-weight models and four behavioral axes, SSS induces large shifts in evil, hallucination, sycophancy, and sentiment while preserving high coherence and general capabilities, turning activation steering into a concrete security concern for white-box and supply-chain LLM deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c42\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u5f15\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\u5b9e\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94feLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u6784\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c42\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u8868\u9762", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u5f15\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e8f\u5217\u5f00\u59cb\u951a\u5b9a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u9650\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6700\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u5c42\u548ctoken\u4e0a", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u884c\u4e3a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u90aa\u6076\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u8c04\u5a9a\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u94feLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u5207\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651LLM\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784"}}

When a tracker shuts down (whether by operator choice, technical failure, or legal action) users lose their contribution history and cannot prove their standing to new communities. We address these problems by storing reputation in smart contracts and replacing self-reports with cryptographic attestations. Receiving peers sign receipts for transferred pieces, which the tracker aggregates and verifies before updating on-chain reputation. Trackers run in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to guarantee correct aggregation and prevent manipulation of state. If a tracker is unavailable, peers use an authenticated Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for discovery: the on-chain reputation acts as a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), so peers can verify each other and maintain access control without the tracker. This design persists reputation across tracker failures and makes it portable to new instances through single-hop migration in factory-deployed contracts. We formalize the security requirements, prove correctness under standard cryptographic assumptions, and evaluate a prototype on Intel TDX. Measurements show that transfer receipts adds less than 6\\% overhead with typical piece sizes, and signature aggregation speeds up verification by $2.5\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316BitTorrent\u4fe1\u8a89\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u79c1\u6709\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4fe1\u8a89\u4e0d\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u548c\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79c1\u6709BitTorrent\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5f31\u70b9\uff1a\u4fe1\u8a89\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u9020\u6210\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u3001\u4e0a\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5f53\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u5173\u95ed\u65f6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u8d21\u732e\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5411\u65b0\u793e\u533a\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4fe1\u8a89\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u5b58\u50a8\u4fe1\u8a89\uff0c\u7528\u52a0\u5bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u63a5\u6536\u65b9\u5bf9\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u7b7e\u540d\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u5728\u53ef\u4fe1\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6536\u636e\u540e\u66f4\u65b0\u94fe\u4e0a\u4fe1\u8a89\u3002\u5f53\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u54c8\u5e0c\u8868\u8fdb\u884c\u8282\u70b9\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u94fe\u4e0a\u4fe1\u8a89\u4f5c\u4e3a\u516c\u94a5\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728Intel TDX\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f20\u8f93\u6536\u636e\u5728\u5178\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u52306%\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u7b7e\u540d\u805a\u5408\u4f7f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u4e45\u4fdd\u5b58\u4fe1\u8a89\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u62b5\u5fa1\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5382\u90e8\u7f72\u5408\u7ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u8df3\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u8a89\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Thread has emerged as a key protocol, widely used in smart-home and commercial systems, and serving as a core transport layer in the Matter standard. This paper presents ThreadFuzzer, the first dedicated fuzzing framework for systematically testing Thread protocol implementations. By manipulating packets at the MLE layer, ThreadFuzzer enables fuzzing of both virtual OpenThread nodes and physical Thread devices. The framework incorporates multiple fuzzing strategies, including Random and Coverage-based fuzzers from CovFuzz, as well as a newly introduced TLV Inserter, designed specifically for TLV-structured MLE messages. These strategies are evaluated on the OpenThread stack using code-coverage and vulnerability-discovery metrics. The evaluation uncovered five previously unknown vulnerabilities in the OpenThread stack, several of which were successfully reproduced on commercial devices that rely on OpenThread. Moreover, ThreadFuzzer was benchmarked against an oracle AFL++ setup using the manually extended OSS-Fuzz harness from OpenThread, demonstrating strong effectiveness. These results demonstrate the practical utility of ThreadFuzzer while highlighting challenges and future directions in the wireless protocol fuzzing research space.", "AI": {"tldr": "ThreadFuzzer\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5Thread\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u7eb5MLE\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u5305\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u865a\u62dfOpenThread\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u7269\u7406Thread\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7f51\u72b6\u7f51\u7edc\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002Thread\u534f\u8bae\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3aMatter\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f20\u8f93\u5c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "ThreadFuzzer\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6765\u81eaCovFuzz\u7684\u968f\u673a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3aTLV\u7ed3\u6784MLE\u6d88\u606f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0TLV\u63d2\u5165\u5668\u3002\u5728OpenThread\u5806\u6808\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86OpenThread\u5806\u6808\u4e2d\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u5148\u524d\u672a\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u51e0\u4e2a\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56OpenThread\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u590d\u73b0\u3002\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u52a8\u6269\u5c55OSS-Fuzz\u7684AFL++\u8bbe\u7f6e\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cThreadFuzzer\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ThreadFuzzer\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u65e0\u7ebf\u534f\u8bae\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Encrypted FHIR resources are stored off-chain; a public blockchain records only cryptographic commitments and patient-signed, time-bounded permissions using EIP-712. Keys are distributed via public-key wrapping, enabling storage providers to remain honest-but-curious without risking confidentiality. We formalize security goals (confidentiality, integrity, cryptographically attributable authorization, and auditability of authorization events) and provide a Solidity reference implementation deployed as single-patient contracts. On-chain costs for permission grants average 78,000 gas (L1), and end-to-end access latency for 1 MB records is 0.7--1.4s (mean values for S3 and IPFS respectively), dominated by storage retrieval. Layer-2 deployment reduces gas usage by 10--13x, though data availability charges dominate actual costs.

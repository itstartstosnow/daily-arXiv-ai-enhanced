In cryptographic traffic analysis, however, violations are defined not by rarity but by explicit policy constraints, including key reuse prohibition, downgrade prevention, and bounded key lifetimes. This fundamental mismatch limits the interpretability and adaptability of conventional anomaly detection methods. We introduce INTACT (INTent-Aware Cryptographic Traffic), a policy-conditioned framework that reformulates violation detection as conditional constraint learning. Instead of learning a static decision boundary over behavioral features, INTACT models the probability of violation conditioned on both observed behavior and declared security intent. The architecture factorizes representation learning into behavioral and intent encoders whose fused embeddings produce a violation score, yielding a policy-parameterized family of decision boundaries. We evaluate the framework on a real-world network flow dataset and a 210,000-trace synthetic multi-intent cryptographic dataset. INTACT matches or exceeds strong unsupervised and supervised baselines, achieving near-perfect discrimination (AUROC up to 1.0000) in the real dataset and consistent superiority in detecting relational and composite violations in the synthetic setting. These results demonstrate that explicit intent conditioning improves discrimination, interpretability, and robustness in cryptographic monitoring."}

While red teaming has long been recognized as an effective method to identify vulnerabilities by simulating real-world attacks, its manual execution is resource-intensive, time-consuming, and lacks scalability for frequent assessments. These limitations have driven the evolution toward auto-mated red teaming, which leverages artificial intelligence and automation to deliver efficient and adaptive security evaluations. This systematic review consolidates existing research on automated red teaming, examining its methodologies, tools, benefits, and limitations. The paper also highlights current trends, challenges, and research gaps, offering insights into future directions for improving automated red teaming as a critical component of proactive cybersecurity strategies. By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how automation enhances red teaming and strengthens organizational resilience against evolving cyber threats."}

In part due to a lack of rigor, logic locking defenses have been historically short-lived, which is an unacceptable risk for hardware-based security solutions for critical systems that may be fielded for decades. Researchers have worked to map the concept of cryptographic indistinguishability to logic locking, as indistinguishability provides strong security guarantees. In an effort to bridge theory and practice, we highlight recent efforts that can be used to analyze the indistinguishability of logic locking techniques, and propose a new method of evaluation based on comparing distributions of $k$-cuts, which is akin to comparing against a library of sub-functions. We evaluate our approach on several different classes of logic locking and show up to 92% average accuracy in correctly identifying which design was locked, even in the presence of resynthesis, suggesting that the evaluated locks do not provide indistinguishability."}

While recent systems incorporate large language models (LLMs), they are still prompt-based, deterministic pipelines that underutilize reasoning capability. We present MemoPhishAgent (MPA), a memory-augmented multi-modal LLM agent that dynamically orchestrates phishing-specific tools and leverages episodic memories of past reasoning trajectories to guide decisions on recurring and novel threats. On two public datasets, MPA outperforms three state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, improving recall by 13.6%. To better reflect realistic, user-facing phishing detection performance, we further evaluate MPA on a benchmark of real-world suspicious URLs actively crawled from five social media platforms, where it improves recall by 20%. Detailed analysis shows episodic memory contributes up to 27% recall gain without introducing additional computational overhead. The ablation study confirms the necessity of the agent-based approach compared to prompt-based baselines and validates the effectiveness of our tool design. Finally, MPA is deployed in production, processing 60K targeted high-risk URLs weekly, and achieving 91.44% recall, providing proactive protection for millions of customers. Together, our results show that combining multi-modal reasoning with episodic memory yields robust phishing detection in realistic user-exposure settings."}

Operating as a model-agnostic overlay, MMA-RAGT mediates a configurable set of internal checkpoints to enforce stateful defence-in-depth. Extensive evaluation on 43,774 instances demonstrates a 6.50x average reduction factor in Attack Success Rate relative to undefended baselines, with negligible utility cost. Crucially, a factorial ablation validates our theoretical bounds: while statefulness and spatial coverage are individually necessary (26.4 pp and 13.6 pp gains respectively), stateless multi-point intervention can yield zero marginal benefit under homogeneous stateless filtering when checkpoint detections are perfectly correlated."}

Based on these conditions, we identify three vulnerability patterns, develop detection and attack-construction algorithms, and validate them in practice. Using the Snort intrusion detection ruleset, our evaluation identifies 45 previously unknown REwB vulnerabilities with quadratic or worse runtime.

This paper introduces a novel, forensics-first framework for achieving quantum resilience in high-consequence environments, with a specific focus on nuclear power plants. We systematically analyze the quantum threat landscape across the Purdue architecture (L0-L5), detailing how Harvest-Now, Decrypt-Later (HNDL) campaigns, enabled by algorithms like Shor's, can retroactively compromise cryptographic foundations, undermine evidence admissibility, and facilitate sophisticated sabotage. Through two detailed case studies, \\textsc{Quantum~Scar} and \\textsc{Quantum~Dawn}, we demonstrate multi-phase attack methodologies where state-level adversaries exploit cryptographic monoculture and extended OT lifecycles to degrade safety systems while creating unsolvable forensic paradoxes. Our probabilistic risk modeling reveals alarming success probabilities (up to 78\\% for targeted facilities under current defenses), underscoring the criticality of immediate action. In response, we propose and validate a phased, defense-in-depth migration path to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), integrating hybrid key exchange, cryptographic diversity, secure time synchronization, and side-channel resistant implementations aligned with ISA/IEC 62443 and NIST standards. The paper concludes that without urgent adoption of quantum-resilient controls, the integrity of both physical safety systems and digital forensic evidence remains at severe and irreversible risk."}

Secure aggregation protects privacy by hiding individual updates, yet it complicates contribution evaluation, which is critical for fair rewards and detecting low-quality or malicious participants. Existing marginal-contribution methods, such as the Shapley value, are incompatible with secure aggregation, and practical alternatives, such as Leave-One-Out, are crude and rely on self-evaluation.\n  We introduce two marginal-difference contribution scores compatible with secure aggregation. Fair-Private satisfies standard fairness axioms, while Everybody-Else eliminates self-evaluation and provides resistance to manipulation, addressing a largely overlooked vulnerability. We provide theoretical guarantees for fairness, privacy, robustness, and computational efficiency, and evaluate our methods on multiple medical image datasets and CIFAR10 in cross-silo settings. Our scores consistently outperform existing baselines, better approximate Shapley-induced client rankings, and improve downstream model performance as well as misbehavior detection. These results demonstrate that fairness, privacy, robustness, and practical utility can be achieved jointly in federated contribution evaluation, offering a principled solution for real-world cross-silo deployments."}

Then we introduce a post-quantum variant of the Minimal IKE protocol, which is essential to make it contemporary, and assess it through Colibri.

Unlike existing tools that depend solely on system response, MulCovFuzz implements a multi-component coverage collection mechanism that dynamically monitors code coverage across different components of the 5G system architecture. Our approach introduces a novel testing paradigm that includes a scoring function combining coverage rewards with efficiency metrics to guide test case generation.

However, FL is highly susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise model integrity and data confidentiality, a vulnerability exacerbated by the fact that conventional data inspection methods are incompatible with its decentralized design. While integrating FL with Blockchain technology has been proposed to address some limitations, its potential for mitigating adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces Resilient Federated Chain (RFC), a novel blockchain-enabled FL framework designed specifically to enhance resilience against such threats. RFC builds upon the existing Proof of Federated Learning architecture by repurposing the redundancy of its Pooled Mining mechanism as an active defense layer that can be combined with robust aggregation rules. Furthermore, the framework introduces a flexible evaluation function in its consensus mechanism, allowing for adaptive defense against different attack strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation on image classification tasks under various adversarial scenarios, demonstrates that RFC significantly improves robustness compared to baseline methods, providing a viable solution for securing decentralized learning environments."}

In this work, we propose APFuzz (Automatic greybox Protocol Fuzzer) with novel designs to increase the smartness of greybox protocol fuzzers from the perspectives of both the state model and the message model.

This paper presents the design, implementation, and validation of SIMPLE-ICS, a virtualised industrial enterprise testbed that enables emulation of multi-stage APT campaigns across IT, OT, and IIoT environments. The testbed architecture is based on the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture, NIST SP 800-82, and IEC 62443 zoning principles and integrates enterprise services, industrial control protocols, and digital twin based process simulation. A systematic methodology inspired by the V model is used to derive architectural requirements, attack scenarios, and validation criteria. An APT campaign designed to mimic the BlackEnergy campaign is emulated using MITRE ATTACK techniques spanning initial enterprise compromise, credential abuse, lateral movement, OT network infiltration, and process manipulation. The testbed supports the synchronised collection of network traffic, host-level logs, and operational telemetry across all segments. The testbed is validated on multi-stage attack trace observability, logging completeness across IT, OT, and IIoT domains, and repeatable execution of APT campaigns.

This survey provides a defense-centered and system-oriented synthesis of security in SemCom via AI defense. We analyze AI-centric threat models by consolidating existing studies and organizing attack surfaces across model-level, channel-realizable, knowledge-based, and networked inference vectors. Building on this foundation, we present a structured taxonomy of defense strategies organized by where semantic integrity can be compromised in SemCom systems despite correct symbol delivery, spanning semantic encoding, wireless transmission, knowledge integrity, and coordination among multiple agents. These categories correspond to distinct security failure modes, including representation fragility, channel-realizable manipulation, semantic prior poisoning or desynchronization, and adversarial propagation through distributed inference. We also examine security utility operating envelopes that capture tradeoffs among semantic fidelity, robustness, latency, and energy under realistic constraints, survey evaluation frameworks and representative applications, and identify open challenges in cross-layer composition and deployment-time certification. Overall, this survey offers a unified system-level perspective that enables readers to understand major threat and defense mechanisms in AI-native SemCom systems and to leverage emerging security techniques in the design and deployment of robust SemCom architectures for next-generation intelligent networks."}

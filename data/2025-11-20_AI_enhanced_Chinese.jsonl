Although numerous prior works have shown that adversarial examples can mislead ML models used in autonomous driving contexts, it remains unclear if these attacks are effective at producing harmful driving actions for various agents, environments, and scenarios.\n  To assess the risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving, we evaluate attacks against a variety of driving agents, rather than against ML models in isolation. To support this evaluation, we leverage CARLA, an urban driving simulator, to create and evaluate adversarial examples. We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model.\n  We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations. Interestingly, we show that, although some attacks can successfully mislead ML models into predicting erroneous stopping or steering commands, some driving agents use modules, such as PID control or GPS-based rules, that can overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u653b\u51fb\u591a\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ee3\u7406\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acbML\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728CARLA\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u5bf9CARLA\u6392\u884c\u699c\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2dML\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u5bb3\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CARLA\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9CARLA\u6392\u884c\u699c\u4e0a\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u653b\u51fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u4ee3\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ee3\u7406\u6240\u6709\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u67d0\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u8bef\u5bfcML\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u505c\u6b62\u6216\u8f6c\u5411\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4f46\u4e00\u4e9b\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ee3\u7406\u4f7f\u7528PID\u63a7\u5236\u6216\u57fa\u4e8eGPS\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u7b49\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684ML\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u6574\u4e2a\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662fML\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, this memory introduces critical risks when sensitive information is revealed in inappropriate contexts. We present CIMemories, a benchmark for evaluating whether LLMs appropriately control information flow from memory based on task context. CIMemories uses synthetic user profiles with over 100 attributes per user, paired with diverse task contexts in which each attribute may be essential for some tasks but inappropriate for others. Our evaluation reveals that frontier models exhibit up to 69% attribute-level violations (leaking information inappropriately), with lower violation rates often coming at the cost of task utility. Violations accumulate across both tasks and runs: as usage increases from 1 to 40 tasks, GPT-5's violations rise from 0.1% to 9.6%, reaching 25.1% when the same prompt is executed 5 times, revealing arbitrary and unstable behavior in which models leak different attributes for identical prompts. Privacy-conscious prompting does not solve this - models overgeneralize, sharing everything or nothing rather than making nuanced, context-dependent decisions. These findings reveal fundamental limitations that require contextually aware reasoning capabilities, not just better prompting or scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "CIMemories\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f53\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u6cc4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe69%\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u6267\u884c\u800c\u7d2f\u79ef\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u6301\u4e45\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u5f53\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u6cc4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u5f53\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efaCIMemories\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b100\u591a\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7528\u6237\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe69%\uff0cGPT-5\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u4ece1\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u76840.1%\u4e0a\u5347\u523040\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u76849.6%\uff0c\u76f8\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u6267\u884c5\u6b21\u65f6\u8fbe\u523025.1%\u3002\u9690\u79c1\u610f\u8bc6\u63d0\u793a\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u6269\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3002"}}

Retraining is limited by the cost and time of manual labeling or sandbox analysis. Existing approaches mitigate this via drift detection and selective labeling, but fully label-free adaptation remains largely unexplored. Recent self-training methods use a previously trained model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and then train a new model on these labels. The unlabeled data are used only for inference and do not participate in training the earlier model. We argue that these unlabeled samples still carry valuable information that can be leveraged when incorporated appropriately into training. This paper introduces LFreeDA, an end-to-end framework that adapts malware classifiers to drift without manual labeling or drift detection. LFreeDA first performs unsupervised domain adaptation on malware images, jointly training on labeled and unlabeled samples to infer pseudo-labels and prune noisy ones. It then adapts a classifier on CFG representations using the labeled and selected pseudo-labeled data, leveraging the scalability of images for pseudo-labeling and the richer semantics of CFGs for final adaptation.

Nevertheless, the security and robustness of QML systems remain underexplored, especially under adversarial conditions. In this paper, we present a systematization of adversarial robustness in QML, integrating conceptual organization with empirical evaluation across three threat models-black-box, gray-box, and white-box. We implement representative attacks in each category, including label-flipping for black-box, QUID encoder-level data poisoning for gray-box, and FGSM and PGD for white-box, using Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) trained on two datasets from distinct domains: MNIST from computer vision and AZ-Class from Android malware, across multiple circuit depths (2, 5, 10, and 50 layers) and two encoding schemes (angle and amplitude). Our evaluation shows that amplitude encoding yields the highest clean accuracy (93% on MNIST and 67% on AZ-Class) in deep, noiseless circuits; however, it degrades sharply under adversarial perturbations and depolarization noise (p=0.01), dropping accuracy below 5%. In contrast, angle encoding, while offering lower representational capacity, remains more stable in shallow, noisy regimes, revealing a trade-off between capacity and robustness. Moreover, the QUID attack attains higher attack success rates, though quantum noise channels disrupt the Hilbert-space correlations it exploits, weakening its impact in image domains. This suggests that noise can act as a natural defense mechanism in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. Overall, our findings guide the development of secure and resilient QML architectures for practical deployment. These insights underscore the importance of designing threat-aware models that remain reliable under real-world noise in NISQ settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u9ed1\u76d2\u3001\u7070\u76d2\u3001\u767d\u76d2\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u5728NISQ\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5929\u7136\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u65bd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff1a\u9ed1\u76d2\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u3001\u7070\u76d2\u7684QUID\u7f16\u7801\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u3001\u767d\u76d2\u7684FGSM\u548cPGD\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5e45\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff08MNIST 93%\uff0cAZ-Class 67%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u81f35%\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff1b\u89d2\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u6d45\u5c42\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1bQUID\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\u4f46\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u566a\u58f0\u5728NISQ\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5929\u7136\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5a01\u80c1\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Their scale and distribution make them especially vulnerable to faults and attacks. Unfortunately, existing fault-tolerant methods either consume excessive resources or provide only eventual guarantees, making them unsuitable for real-time resource-constrained CPS.\n  We present GeoShield, a resource-efficient solution for defending geo-distributed CPS against Byzantine faults. GeoShield leverages the property that CPS are designed to tolerate brief disruptions and maintain safety, as long as they recover (i.e., resume normal operations or transition to a safe mode) within a bounded amount of time following a fault. Instead of masking faults, it detects them and recovers the system within bounded time, thus guaranteeing safety with much fewer resources. GeoShield introduces protocols for Byzantine fault-resilient network measurement and inter-region omission fault detection that proactively detect malicious message delays, along with recovery mechanisms that guarantee timely recovery while maximizing operational robustness. It is the first bounded-time recovery solution that operates effectively under unreliable networks without relying on trusted hardware. Evaluations using real-world case studies show that it significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and resource efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoShield\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4fe1\u606f\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u5bb9\u9519\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4fe1\u606f\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7531\u4e8e\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6545\u969c\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5bb9\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u7ec8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684CPS\u3002", "method": "GeoShield\u5229\u7528CPS\u80fd\u591f\u5bb9\u5fcd\u77ed\u6682\u4e2d\u65ad\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u5bb9\u9519\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u9057\u6f0f\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u4e3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u6d88\u606f\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5907\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6709\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6062\u590d\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aGeoShield\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u4fe1\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u6709\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u6062\u590d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoShield\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fCPS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u5bb9\u9519\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002"}}

While major security scanners focus on identifying known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in open-source packages, there are very few studies on detecting malicious packages. Malicious open-source package detection typically requires static, dynamic analysis, or both. Dynamic analysis is more effective as it can expose a package's behaviors at runtime. However, current dynamic analysis tools (e.g., ossf's package-analysis) lack an automatic method to differentiate malicious packages from benign packages. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract the features from dynamic analysis (e.g., executed commands) and leverage machine learning techniques to automatically classify packages as benign or malicious. Our evaluation of nearly 2000 packages on npm shows that the machine learning classifier achieves an AUC of 0.91 with a false positive rate of nearly 0%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6076\u610f\u5f00\u6e90\u5305\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728npm\u5305\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52300.91 AUC\u548c\u63a5\u8fd10%\u7684\u8bef\u62a5\u7387", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6076\u610f\u5f00\u6e90\u5305\u6570\u91cf\u6025\u5267\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u626b\u63cf\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5df2\u77e5CVE\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6076\u610f\u5305\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u533a\u5206\u6076\u610f\u5305\u548c\u826f\u6027\u5305\u7684\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u4ece\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u6267\u884c\u7684\u547d\u4ee4\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u5305\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u826f\u6027\u6216\u6076\u610f", "result": "\u5728\u8fd12000\u4e2anpm\u5305\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fbe\u52300.91\u7684AUC\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u63a5\u8fd10%", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u5f00\u6e90\u5305\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387"}}

The core idea is to validate quantified resolution proofs (Q-Res) in ZK. We develop an efficient polynomial encoding of Q-Res proofs, enabling proof validation through low-overhead arithmetic checks. We also design a ZK protocol to prove knowledge of a winning strategy related to the QBF, which is often equally important in practice. We implement our protocols and evaluate them on QBFEVAL.

Current AI systems operate on opaque data structures that lack the audit trails, provenance tracking, or explainability required by emerging regulations like the EU AI Act. We propose an artifact-centric AI agent paradigm where behavior is driven by persistent, verifiable data artifacts rather than ephemeral tasks, solving the trustworthiness problem at the data architecture level. Central to this approach is the Multimodal Artifact File Format (MAIF), an AI-native container embedding semantic representations, cryptographic provenance, and granular access controls. MAIF transforms data from passive storage into active trust enforcement, making every AI operation inherently auditable. Our production-ready implementation demonstrates ultra-high-speed streaming (2,720.7 MB/s), optimized video processing (1,342 MB/s), and enterprise-grade security. Novel algorithms for cross-modal attention, semantic compression, and cryptographic binding achieve up to 225 compression while maintaining semantic fidelity. Advanced security features include stream-level access control, real-time tamper detection, and behavioral anomaly analysis with minimal overhead. This approach directly addresses the regulatory, security, and accountability challenges preventing AI deployment in sensitive domains, offering a viable path toward trustworthy AI systems at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u4ef6\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8AI\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3AI\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5371\u673a\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u662fMAIF\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u3001\u52a0\u5bc6\u6eaf\u6e90\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u64cd\u4f5c\u5177\u5907\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5371\u673a\u963b\u788dAI\u9769\u547d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u6765\u6e90\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u7b49\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u5de5\u4ef6\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1MAIF\u683c\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3aAI\u539f\u751f\u5bb9\u5668\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u3001\u52a0\u5bc6\u6eaf\u6e90\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7b49\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u4ea7\u5c31\u7eea\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c55\u793a\u8d85\u9ad8\u901f\u6d41\u5904\u7406(2,720.7 MB/s)\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406(1,342 MB/s)\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u7f29\u8fbe\u5230225\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u7279\u6027\u5305\u62ec\u6d41\u7ea7\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7be1\u6539\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u963b\u788dAI\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we present the first comprehensive analysis of IPI-centric defense frameworks. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of these defenses, classifying them along five dimensions. We then thoroughly assess the security and usability of representative defense frameworks. Through analysis of defensive failures in the assessment, we identify six root causes of defense circumvention. Based on these findings, we design three novel adaptive attacks that significantly improve attack success rates targeting specific frameworks, demonstrating the severity of the flaws in these defenses.

This article presents a unified perspective on cross-domain vulnerabilities that arise across integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), federated learning (FL), digital twins (DTs), diffusion models (DMs), and large telecommunication models (LTMs). We highlight emerging adversarial agents such as compromised DTs and LTMs that can manipulate both the physical and cognitive layers of 6G systems. To address these risks, we propose an adaptive evolutionary defense (AED) concept that continuously co-evolves with attacks through GenAI-driven simulation and feedback, combining physical-layer protection, secure learning pipelines, and cognitive-layer resilience. A case study using an LLM-based port prediction model for fluid-antenna systems demonstrates the susceptibility of GenAI modules to adversarial perturbations and the effectiveness of the proposed defense concept.

While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728CSMIM\u534f\u8bae\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u9690\u79c1\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f(PETs)\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u52a0\u6cd5\u79d8\u5bc6\u5171\u4eab\u65b9\u6848\u89e3\u51b3\u98de\u673a\u5ba2\u8231IoT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u98de\u673a\u5ba2\u8231\u4e2d\u591a\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546IoT\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0e\u4e58\u5ba2\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u53ca\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5e94\u7528\u5c42\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728CSMIM\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u52a0\u6cd5\u79d8\u5bc6\u5171\u4eab\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53f0\u91cf\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u6548\u7528\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "PETs\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u56fa\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u534f\u8bae\u5ef6\u8fdf\u901a\u5e38\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8ePETs\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u9002\u5f53\u7684PETs\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u534f\u4f5cIoT\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Traditional machine learning approaches for phishing detection often require extensive feature engineering, continuous retraining, and costly infrastructure maintenance. At the same time, proprietary large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in phishing-related classification tasks, but their operational costs and reliance on external providers limit their practical adoption in many business environments. This paper investigates the feasibility of small language models (SLMs) for detecting phishing websites using only their raw HTML code. A key advantage of these models is that they can be deployed on local infrastructure, providing organisations with greater control over data and operations. We systematically evaluate 15 commonly used Small Language Models (SLMs), ranging from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters, benchmarking their classification accuracy, computational requirements, and cost-efficiency. Our results highlight the trade-offs between detection performance and resource consumption, demonstrating that while SLMs underperform compared to state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs, they can still provide a viable and scalable alternative to external LLM services. By presenting a comparative analysis of costs and benefits, this work lays the foundation for future research on the adaptation, fine-tuning, and deployment of SLMs in phishing detection systems, aiming to balance security effectiveness and economic practicality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(SLMs)\u68c0\u6d4b\u9493\u9c7c\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8615\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528SLM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SLMs\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ca\u4e13\u6709LLMs\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u9493\u9c7c\u7f51\u7ad9\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u597d\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f3015\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(1B-70B\u53c2\u6570)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cbHTML\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u9493\u9c7c\u7f51\u7ad9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "result": "SLMs\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5982\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4e13\u6709LLMs\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "SLMs\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76SLMs\u5728\u9493\u9c7c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In practice, however, many real-world exits violate these assumptions by splitting the attack across both time and actor dimensions: attackers break total extraction into many low-impact trades and route proceeds through multiple non-owner addresses, producing low-visibility drains.\n  We formalize this family of attacks as the fragmented rug pull (FRP) and offer a compact recipe for a slow-stewed beef special: (i) keep the lid on (to preserve LP control so on-chain extraction remains feasible), (ii) chop thin slices (to split the total exit volume into many low-impact micro-trades that individually fall below impact thresholds), and (iii) pass the ladle (to delegate sells across multiple wallets so that each participant takes a small share of the extraction). Technically, we define three atomic predicate groups and show that their orthogonal combinations yield evasive strategies overlooked by prior heuristics (USENIX Sec 19, USENIX Sec 23).\n  We validate the model with large-scale measurements. Our corpus contains 303,614 LPs, among which 105,434 are labeled as FRP pools. The labeled subset includes 34,192,767 pool-related transactions and 401,838 inflated-seller wallets, involving 1,501,408 unique interacting addresses. Notably, owner-wallet participation in inflated selling among FRP-flagged LPs has declined substantially (33.1% of cases), indicating a shift in scam behavior: the liquidity drain is no longer held on the owner wallet. We also detected 127,252 wallets acting as serial scammers when repeatedly engaging in inflated selling across multiple FRP LPs. Our empirical findings demonstrate that the evasive strategies we define are widespread and operationally significant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\u62c9\u5730\u6bef\u653b\u51fb(FRP)\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5927\u989d\u63d0\u53d6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u989d\u4ea4\u6613\u5e76\u5206\u6563\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u94b1\u5305\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c4\u907f\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u62c9\u5730\u6bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5047\u8bbe\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6301\u6709\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6c60\u4ee3\u5e01\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5927\u989d\u5356\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u653b\u51fb\u8fdd\u53cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6563\u5316\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u788e\u7247\u5316\u62c9\u5730\u6bef\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u539f\u5b50\u8c13\u8bcd\u7ec4\uff1a(1)\u4fdd\u6301\u63a7\u5236\u6743\uff0c(2)\u8584\u7247\u5207\u5272(\u5c06\u9000\u51fa\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u4ea4\u6613)\uff0c(3)\u4f20\u9012\u52fa\u5b50(\u5c06\u5356\u51fa\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9\u591a\u4e2a\u94b1\u5305)\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u4ea7\u751f\u89c4\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728303,614\u4e2a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6c60\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa105,434\u4e2aFRP\u6c60\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca34,192,767\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\u548c401,838\u4e2a\u81a8\u80c0\u5356\u51fa\u94b1\u5305\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8005\u94b1\u5305\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u964d\u81f333.1%\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230127,252\u4e2a\u91cd\u590d\u53c2\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2aFRP\u6c60\u7684\u4e32\u884c\u8bc8\u9a97\u94b1\u5305\u3002", "conclusion": "\u788e\u7247\u5316\u62c9\u5730\u6bef\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u7c7b\u89c4\u907f\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

This work introduces the concept of a block synchronizer, a simple abstraction that drives incremental block retrieval and enforces resource-aware exchange. Its interface and role fit cleanly inside a modern BFT consensus stack. We also uncover a new attack, where an adversary steers honest validators into redundant, uncoordinated pulls that exhaust bandwidth and stall progress. Beluga is a modular and scarcity-aware instantiation of the block synchronizer. It achieves optimal common-case latency while bounding the cost of recovery under faults and adversarial behavior. We integrate Beluga into Mysticeti, the consensus core of the Sui blockchain, and show on a geo-distributed AWS deployment that Beluga sustains optimal performance in the optimistic path and, under attack, delivers up to 3x higher throughput and 25x lower latency than prior designs.

One of the main challenges is creating high-quality input seeds that\nmaximize coverage and speed up verification. Coverage-Guided Fuzzing (CGF)\nmethods help explore designs more effectively, but they struggle to focus on\nspecific parts of the hardware. Existing Directed Gray-box Fuzzing (DGF)\ntechniques like DirectFuzz try to solve this by generating targeted tests, but\nit has major drawbacks, such as supporting only limited hardware description\nlanguages, not scaling well to large circuits, and having issues with\nabstraction mismatches. To address these problems, we introduce a novel\nframework, PROFUZZ, that follows the DGF approach and combines fuzzing with\nAutomatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) for more efficient fuzzing. By\nleveraging ATPG's structural analysis capabilities, PROFUZZ can generate\nprecise input seeds that target specific design regions more effectively while\nmaintaining high fuzzing throughput. Our experiments show that PROFUZZ scales\n30x better than DirectFuzz when handling multiple target sites, improves\ncoverage by 11.66%, and runs 2.76x faster, highlighting its scalability and\neffectiveness for directed fuzzing in complex hardware systems."}

Inspired by the positive impact of the adversarial attack, a\npair of pluggable encryption and decryption modules is designed in the proposed\nSS-ISAC framework. The encryption module is installed after the semantic\ntransmitter, adopting a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to create\nthe adversarial attack. Correspondingly, the decryption module before the\nsemantic receiver utilizes another trainable ARN to mitigate the adversarial\nattack and noise. These two modules can be flexibly assembled considering the\nsystem security demands, without drastically modifying the hardware\ninfrastructure. To ensure the sensing and communication (SAC) performance while\npreventing the eavesdropping threat, the above ARNs are jointly optimized by\nminimizing a carefully designed loss function that relates to the adversarial\nattack power, SAC performance, as well as the privacy leakage risk.

This study first identifies a\nsignificant issue with widely adopted feature extraction tools (e.g.,\nCICMeterFlow): the extensive use of time- and length-related features leads to\nhigh sparsity, which adversely affects model convergence. Furthermore, existing\ntraffic detection methods generally lack an embedding mechanism capable of\nefficiently and comprehensively capturing the semantic characteristics of\nnetwork traffic. To address these challenges, we propose a novel feature\nextraction tool that eliminates traditional time and length features in favor\nof context-aware semantic features related to the source host, thus improving\nthe generalizability of the model. In addition, we design an embedding training\nframework that integrates the unsupervised DBSCAN clustering algorithm with a\ncontrastive learning strategy to effectively capture fine-grained semantic\nrepresentations of traffic.

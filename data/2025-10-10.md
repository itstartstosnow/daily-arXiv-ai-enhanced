### [1] [PATCH: Mitigating PII Leakage in Language Models with Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07452)
*Anthony Hughes,Vasisht Duddu,N. Asokan,Nikolaos Aletras,Ning Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出PATCH方法，通过识别和编辑语言模型中负责PII泄露的计算电路来减少隐私泄露，相比现有防御方法在隐私-效用权衡方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型可能从训练数据中记忆个人身份信息(PII)，现有防御机制如差分隐私会显著降低模型效用。研究发现特定PII泄露电路是导致此行为的原因。

Method: 使用电路发现技术识别负责PII泄露的计算电路，然后直接编辑这些电路以减少泄露。PATCH还可与差分隐私结合使用。

Result: PATCH将语言模型的PII泄露召回率降低高达65%，与差分隐私结合时可将残留泄露召回率降至0.01%。

Conclusion: PII泄露电路在现有防御机制应用后仍然存在，而PATCH能有效缓解其影响，提供更好的隐私保护效果。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII)
from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference.
Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this
leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using
circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII
leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should
be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware
Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and
subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves
better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall
of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to
reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis
shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing
defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.

### [2] [Comparison of Fully Homomorphic Encryption and Garbled Circuit Techniques in Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07457)
*Kalyan Cheerla,Lotfi Ben Othmane,Kirill Morozov*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 比较全同态加密(FHE)和混淆电路(GC)在安全神经网络推理中的性能表现，揭示GC在速度和内存方面更优，而FHE支持非交互式推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在医疗、金融等敏感领域的应用，数据隐私和模型保密性成为重要挑战，需要隐私保护机器学习技术

Method: 使用微软SEAL库的CKKS方案实现FHE，使用IntelLabs的TinyGarble2.0框架实现GC，构建两层神经网络并在半诚实威胁模型下评估

Result: GC在执行速度和内存消耗方面表现更好，而FHE支持非交互式推理，两者存在权衡关系

Conclusion: FHE和GC在安全神经网络推理中各具优势，GC更适合对性能要求高的场景，FHE更适合需要非交互式的场景

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is making its way into fields such as healthcare,
finance, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), and concerns over data privacy
and model confidentiality continue to grow. Privacy-preserving Machine Learning
(PPML) addresses this challenge by enabling inference on private data without
revealing sensitive inputs or proprietary models. Leveraging Secure Computation
techniques from Cryptography, two widely studied approaches in this domain are
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Garbled Circuits (GC). This work
presents a comparative evaluation of FHE and GC for secure neural network
inference. A two-layer neural network (NN) was implemented using the CKKS
scheme from the Microsoft SEAL library (FHE) and the TinyGarble2.0 framework
(GC) by IntelLabs. Both implementations are evaluated under the semi-honest
threat model, measuring inference output error, round-trip time, peak memory
usage, communication overhead, and communication rounds. Results reveal a
trade-off: modular GC offers faster execution and lower memory consumption,
while FHE supports non-interactive inference.

### [3] [A Secure Authentication-Driven Protected Data Collection Protocol in Internet of Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07462)
*Maryam Ataei Nezhad,Hamid Barati,Ali Barati*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种三阶段安全通信方法，通过星型结构、多跳加密和认证协议来保护物联网通信安全，在能耗、延迟、灵活性等方面优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网在家庭、组织和私人公司的普及，隐私和信息安全成为最大关切。用户信息被黑客窃取的问题阻碍了物联网的推广。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 在每个集群内构建星型结构，子节点与父节点共享唯一密钥加密通信；2) 集群内多跳通信，每跳使用不同密钥加密，连接结束时更新密钥；3) 使用认证协议增强集群间通信安全，防止恶意节点。

Result: 使用NS2软件模拟，结果显示在能耗、端到端延迟、灵活性、数据包交付率和存活节点数量方面均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的三阶段安全通信方法有效解决了物联网中的安全问题，在多个性能指标上表现出色，为物联网的安全部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Internet of Things means connecting different devices through the Internet.
The Internet of things enables humans to remotely manage and control the
objects they use with the Internet infrastructure. After the advent of the
Internet of Things in homes, organizations, and private companies, privacy and
information security are the biggest concern. This issue has challenged the
spread of the Internet of things as news of the users theft of information by
hackers intensified. The proposed method in this paper consists of three
phases. In the first phase, a star structure is constructed within each
cluster, and a unique key is shared between each child and parent to encrypt
and secure subsequent communications. The second phase is for intracluster
communications, in which members of the cluster send their data to the cluster
head in a multi hop manner. Also, in this phase, the data is encrypted with
different keys in each hop, and at the end of each connection, the keys are
updated to ensure data security. The third phase is to improve the security of
inter cluster communications using an authentication protocol. In this way, the
cluster heads are authenticated before sending information to prevent malicious
nodes in the network. The proposed method is also simulated using NS2 software.
The results showed that the proposed method has improved in terms of energy
consumption, end-to-end delay, flexibility, packet delivery rate, and the
number of alive nodes compared to other methods.

### [4] [MIRANDA: short signatures from a leakage-free full-domain-hash scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07479)
*Alain Couvreur,Thomas Debris-Alazard,Philippe Gaborit,Adrien Vinçotte*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Miranda是基于矩阵码的首个全域哈希签名方案，采用GPV范式提供强安全性保证。该方案使用简单的陷门结构，无需拒绝采样，签名大小仅90字节，公钥大小约2.6MB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发基于矩阵码的GPV签名方案，避免复杂拒绝采样过程，简化实现难度，同时保持强安全性。

Method: 使用Gabidulin码作为矩阵空间，基于可解码码的子码构造陷门，通过少量均匀比特绘制确保签名不泄露陷门信息。

Result: 在128位经典安全级别下，签名大小仅90字节，公钥大小约2.6MB，实现了高效的签名方案。

Conclusion: Miranda是首个基于矩阵码的GPV签名方案，具有简单实现、强安全性和紧凑签名的优势。

Abstract: We present $\mathsf{Miranda}$, the first family of full-domain-hash
signatures based on matrix codes. This signature scheme fulfils the paradigm of
Gentry, Peikert and Vaikuntanathan ($\mathsf{GPV}$), which gives strong
security guarantees. Our trapdoor is very simple and generic: if we propose it
with matrix codes, it can actually be instantiated in many other ways since it
only involves a subcode of a decodable code (or lattice) in a unique decoding
regime of parameters. Though $\mathsf{Miranda}$ signing algorithm relies on a
decoding task where there is exactly one solution, there are many possible
signatures given a message to sign and we ensure that signatures are not
leaking information on their underlying trapdoor by means of a very simple
procedure involving the drawing of a small number of uniform bits. In
particular $\mathsf{Miranda}$ does not use a rejection sampling procedure which
makes its implementation a very simple task contrary to other
$\mathsf{GPV}$-like signatures schemes such as $\mathsf{Falcon}$ or even
$\mathsf{Wave}$.
  We instantiate $\mathsf{Miranda}$ with the famous family of Gabidulin codes
represented as spaces of matrices and we study thoroughly its security (in the
EUF-CMA security model). For~$128$ bits of classical security, the signature
sizes are as low as~$90$ bytes and the public key sizes are in the order
of~$2.6$ megabytes.

### [5] [EMPalm: Exfiltrating Palm Biometric Data via Electromagnetic Side-Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07533)
*Haowen Xu,Tianya Zhao,Xuyu Wang,Lei Ma,Jun Dai,Alexander Wyglinski,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EMPalm攻击框架通过窃听电磁信号，能够隐蔽地恢复手掌生物特征信息，包括掌纹和掌静脉图像，对现有手掌识别系统构成严重安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手掌识别系统在运行时会无意中发射电磁信号，研究发现这些电磁泄露会泄漏手掌生物特征信息，因此开发EMPalm攻击框架来评估安全风险。

Method: 首先分离两种模态的交织传输，识别并组合其信息频段，重建图像，然后使用扩散模型恢复细粒度生物特征。

Result: 在7个原型和2个商业设备上测试，EMPalm能够以高视觉保真度恢复手掌生物特征，SSIM达0.79，PSNR达29.88 dB，FID低至6.82。对4个先进手掌识别模型的平均欺骗成功率达65.30%。

Conclusion: 手掌识别系统的电磁泄露构成严重安全威胁，EMPalm攻击框架证明了从电磁信号中恢复手掌生物特征的可行性，需要加强系统安全防护。

Abstract: Palm recognition has emerged as a dominant biometric authentication
technology in critical infrastructure. These systems operate in either
single-modal form, using palmprint or palmvein individually, or dual-modal
form, fusing the two modalities. Despite this diversity, they share similar
hardware architectures that inadvertently emit electromagnetic (EM) signals
during operation. Our research reveals that these EM emissions leak palm
biometric information, motivating us to develop EMPalm--an attack framework
that covertly recovers both palmprint and palmvein images from eavesdropped EM
signals. Specifically, we first separate the interleaved transmissions of the
two modalities, identify and combine their informative frequency bands, and
reconstruct the images. To further enhance fidelity, we employ a diffusion
model to restore fine-grained biometric features unique to each domain.
Evaluations on seven prototype and two commercial palm acquisition devices show
that EMPalm can recover palm biometric information with high visual fidelity,
achieving SSIM scores up to 0.79, PSNR up to 29.88 dB, and FID scores as low as
6.82 across all tested devices, metrics that collectively demonstrate strong
structural similarity, high signal quality, and low perceptual discrepancy. To
assess the practical implications of the attack, we further evaluate it against
four state-of-the-art palm recognition models, achieving a model-wise average
spoofing success rate of 65.30% over 6,000 samples from 100 distinct users.

### [6] [A Minrank-based Encryption Scheme à la Alekhnovich-Regev](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07584)
*Thomas Debris-Alazard,Philippe Gaborit,Romaric Neveu,Olivier Ruatta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了基于stationary-MinRank问题的公钥加密方案，该方案的安全性仅依赖于MinRank问题的难度，无需其他安全假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建仅基于MinRank问题难度的加密方案，解决长期存在的开放性问题。Alekhnovich和Regev的方案仅基于随机线性码解码和LWE的平均难度，而本工作将这种强安全性保证扩展到MinRank问题。

Method: 通过证明stationary-MinRank问题具有搜索到决策的归约特性，构建了基于该问题的加密方案。这是对Alekhnovich和Regev加密方案的改编。

Result: 方案具有实用性，与具有类似强安全性保证的其他加密方案相比具有竞争力。效率略低于FrodoKEM，但远优于Alekhnovich和Regev的原始方案，且可通过考虑更多结构进行改进。

Conclusion: 该工作为仅基于MinRank问题难度的加密方案构建提供了部分答案，证明了基于stationary-MinRank的加密方案是可行且具有竞争力的。

Abstract: Introduced in 2003 and 2005, Alekhnovich and Regev' schemes were the first
public-key encryptions whose security is only based on the average hardness of
decoding random linear codes and LWE, without other security assumptions. Such
security guarantees made them very popular, being at the origin of the now
standardized HQC or Kyber.
  We present an adaptation of Alekhnovich and Regev' encryption scheme whose
security is only based on the hardness of a slight variation of MinRank, the
so-called stationary-MinRank problem. We succeeded to reach this strong
security guarantee by showing that stationary-MinRank benefits from a
search-to-decision reduction. Our scheme therefore brings a partial answer to
the long-standing open question of building an encryption scheme whose security
relies solely on the hardness of MinRank.
  Finally, we show after a thoroughly security analysis that our scheme is
practical and competitive with other encryption schemes admitting such strong
security guarantees. Our scheme is slightly less efficient than FrodoKEM, but
much more efficient than Alekhnovich and Regev' original schemes, with
possibilities of improvements by considering more structure, in the same way as
HQC and Kyber.

### [7] [Rethinking Reasoning: A Survey on Reasoning-based Backdoors in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07697)
*Man Hu,Xinyi Wu,Zuofeng Suo,Jinbo Feng,Linghui Meng,Yanhao Jia,Anh Tuan Luu,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文首次对基于推理的后门攻击进行全面综述，提出了新的分类法将此类攻击分为关联型、被动型和主动型，并讨论了相应的防御策略和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型推理能力的提升，攻击者可能利用这些能力进行后门攻击，但现有研究缺乏对针对LLM推理能力的后门攻击和防御的深入分析。

Method: 提出了新的分类法，从统一视角总结现有方法，将基于推理的后门攻击分为三类：关联型、被动型和主动型，并分析了其机制和方法框架。

Result: 建立了针对LLM推理能力的后门攻击分类体系，提供了防御策略分析，识别了当前挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 这项工作为安全可信的LLM社区探索提供了新视角，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rise of advanced reasoning capabilities, large language models
(LLMs) are receiving increasing attention. However, although reasoning improves
LLMs' performance on downstream tasks, it also introduces new security risks,
as adversaries can exploit these capabilities to conduct backdoor attacks.
Existing surveys on backdoor attacks and reasoning security offer comprehensive
overviews but lack in-depth analysis of backdoor attacks and defenses targeting
LLMs' reasoning abilities. In this paper, we take the first step toward
providing a comprehensive review of reasoning-based backdoor attacks in LLMs by
analyzing their underlying mechanisms, methodological frameworks, and
unresolved challenges. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that offers a
unified perspective for summarizing existing approaches, categorizing
reasoning-based backdoor attacks into associative, passive, and active. We also
present defense strategies against such attacks and discuss current challenges
alongside potential directions for future research. This work offers a novel
perspective, paving the way for further exploration of secure and trustworthy
LLM communities.

### [8] [ANCORA: Accurate Intrusion Recovery for Web Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07806)
*Yihao Peng,Biao Ma,Hai Wan,Xibin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ANCORA是一个精确的Web应用入侵恢复系统，通过隔离恶意请求的系统调用序列，分别追踪文件修改和数据库操作，实现选择性回滚和重放，在保持合法数据的同时完全移除攻击影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代Web应用恢复面临关键困境：粗粒度快照回滚会导致合法用户数据丢失，而精确移除攻击影响在高并发环境中难以实现，因为难以将文件和数据库修改归因于特定的攻击请求。

Method: ANCORA首先隔离恶意请求触发的完整系统调用序列。对于文件修改，构建溯源图追踪所有修改；对于数据库操作，引入基于网络连接元组和活动时间窗口的时空锚点来精确定位操作。然后执行统一回滚和选择性重放恢复。

Result: 在10个Web应用和20个CVE攻击场景中测试，并发高达150个连接。ANCORA实现了99.9%的恢复准确率，最坏情况下响应延迟增加19.8%、QPS降低17.8%，恢复吞吐量为110.7个数据库操作/秒和27.2个受影响文件/秒。

Conclusion: ANCORA能够有效保护合法数据，完全移除攻击影响，在Web应用入侵恢复方面提供了精确且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern web application recovery presents a critical dilemma. Coarse-grained
snapshot rollbacks cause unacceptable data loss for legitimate users.
Surgically removing an attack's impact is hindered by a fundamental challenge
in high-concurrency environments: it is difficult to attribute resulting file
and database modifications to a specific attack-related request. We present
ANCORA, a system for precise intrusion recovery in web applications without
invasive instrumentation. ANCORA first isolates the full sequence of syscalls
triggered by a single malicious request. Based on this sequence, ANCORA
addresses file and database modifications separately. To trace file changes, it
builds a provenance graph that reveals all modifications, including those by
exploit-spawned processes. To attribute database operations, a more difficult
challenge due to connection pooling, ANCORA introduces a novel spatiotemporal
anchor. This anchor uses the request's network connection tuple and active time
window to pinpoint exact database operations. With all malicious file and
database operations precisely identified, ANCORA performs a unified rewind and
selective replay recovery. It reverts the system to a clean snapshot taken
before the attack, then selectively re-applies only legitimate operations to
both the file system and database. This completely removes the attack's effects
while preserving concurrent legitimate data. We evaluated ANCORA on 10 web
applications and 20 CVE-based attack scenarios with concurrency up to 150
connections. Experiments demonstrate ANCORA achieves 99.9% recovery accuracy
with manageable overhead: up to 19.8% response latency increase and 17.8% QPS
decrease in worst cases, and recovery throughput of 110.7 database operations
per second and 27.2 affected files per second, effectively preserving
legitimate data.

### [9] [Effective and Stealthy One-Shot Jailbreaks on Deployed Mobile Vision-Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07809)
*Renhua Ding,Xiao Yang,Zhengwei Fang,Jun Luo,Kun He,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一种针对大型视觉语言模型移动代理的隐蔽一次性越狱攻击，利用应用内提示注入，通过ADB操作时暴露恶意提示来劫持代理行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖明显的UI覆盖、高权限或不切实际的威胁模型，限制了隐蔽性和实际应用性，需要研究更实用的隐蔽攻击方法。

Method: 包含三个关键组件：低权限感知链目标注入、隐蔽用户不可见激活机制、以及一次性提示有效性搜索算法(HG-IDA*)。

Result: 在多个LVLM后端评估中，单次攻击场景下观察到高劫持率（如GPT-4o：82.5%规划/75.0%执行）。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了当前移动代理的基本安全漏洞，对自主智能手机操作具有直接影响。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) enable autonomous mobile agents to
operate smartphone user interfaces, yet vulnerabilities to UI-level attacks
remain critically understudied. Existing research often depends on conspicuous
UI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting
stealth and real-world applicability. In this paper, we present a practical and
stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections:
malicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during
human interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android
Debug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1)
low-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious
apps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a
touch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical
touch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3)
one-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level
iterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot,
keyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters. We evaluate
across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and
representative open-source models within three Android applications, and we
observe high planning and execution hijack rates in single-shot scenarios
(e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution). These findings expose a
fundamental security vulnerability in current mobile agents with immediate
implications for autonomous smartphone operation.

*Georgios Diamantopoulos,Nikos Tziritas,Rami Bahsoon,Georgios Theodoropoulos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出基于数字孪生的动态去中心化区块链管理机制，通过二级区块链系统实现决策协调，在保持去中心化的同时实现动态管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前区块链治理方案在控制与去中心化之间存在权衡，需要一种既能保持去中心化又能实现动态管理的解决方案。

Method: 利用多个由利益相关者控制的数字孪生，组织在二级区块链系统中进行去中心化决策协调和传播。

Result: 模拟评估显示该机制能够快速达成决策共识，并以最小开销重新配置主区块链。

Conclusion: 该机制成功实现了无需集中控制的区块链系统管理，平衡了控制与去中心化的需求。

Abstract: The necessity of blockchain systems to remain decentralised limits current
solutions to blockchain governance and dynamic management, forcing a trade-off
between control and decentralisation. In light of the above, this work proposes
a dynamic and decentralised blockchain management mechanism based on digital
twins. To ensure decentralisation, the proposed mechanism utilises multiple
digital twins that the system's stakeholders control. To facilitate
decentralised decision-making, the twins are organised in a secondary
blockchain system that orchestrates agreement on, and propagation of decisions
to the managed blockchain. This enables the management of blockchain systems
without centralised control. A preliminary evaluation of the performance and
impact of the overheads introduced by the proposed mechanism is conducted
through simulation. The results demonstrate the proposed mechanism's ability to
reach consensus on decisions quickly and reconfigure the primary blockchain
with minimal overhead.

### [11] [From Defender to Devil? Unintended Risk Interactions Induced by LLM Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07968)
*Xiangtao Meng,Tianshuo Cong,Li Wang,Wenyu Chen,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo,Xiaoyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了CrossRiskEval评估框架，首次系统研究LLM防御措施在安全、公平和隐私三个风险维度之间的意外交互作用，发现防御一个风险可能会对其他风险产生负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM防御策略研究大多孤立评估单一风险，忽视了防御措施在不同风险维度之间可能产生的复杂交互影响，需要全面评估防御策略的副作用。

Method: 提出CrossRiskEval综合评估框架，对14个部署了12种不同防御策略的LLM进行实证研究，并通过细粒度神经元级分析揭示底层机制。

Result: 研究发现：1）安全防御可能抑制对偏置或隐私相关查询的直接响应，但仍会放大间接隐私泄露或偏置输出；2）公平防御增加误用和隐私泄露风险；3）隐私防御通常损害安全性并加剧偏置。神经元分析揭示了存在冲突纠缠神经元。

Conclusion: 呼吁LLM风险评估范式转变，转向对防御策略进行整体、交互感知的评估，而非孤立考虑单一风险维度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various
applications, but their deployment in sensitive domains raises significant
concerns. To mitigate these risks, numerous defense strategies have been
proposed. However, most existing studies assess these defenses in isolation,
overlooking their broader impacts across other risk dimensions. In this work,
we take the first step in investigating unintended interactions caused by
defenses in LLMs, focusing on the complex interplay between safety, fairness,
and privacy. Specifically, we propose CrossRiskEval, a comprehensive evaluation
framework to assess whether deploying a defense targeting one risk
inadvertently affects others. Through extensive empirical studies on 14
defense-deployed LLMs, covering 12 distinct defense strategies, we reveal
several alarming side effects: 1) safety defenses may suppress direct responses
to sensitive queries related to bias or privacy, yet still amplify indirect
privacy leakage or biased outputs; 2) fairness defenses increase the risk of
misuse and privacy leakage; 3) privacy defenses often impair safety and
exacerbate bias. We further conduct a fine-grained neuron-level analysis to
uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Our analysis reveals the
existence of conflict-entangled neurons in LLMs that exhibit opposing
sensitivities across multiple risk dimensions. Further trend consistency
analysis at both task and neuron levels confirms that these neurons play a key
role in mediating the emergence of unintended behaviors following defense
deployment. We call for a paradigm shift in LLM risk evaluation, toward
holistic, interaction-aware assessment of defense strategies.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 发现了一个关于随机置换排序系统中共轭可观测量的基本组合定律，该定律通过功能关系连接离散置换计数和连续经过时间，实现熵纯化，将微架构时序波动转化为均匀随机性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为从通用计算中生成可证明均匀的随机性提供理论基础，从涌现的计算动力学中确保密码学纯度。

Method: 建立连接时序分布特征函数和置换计数概率生成函数的功能关系框架，通过几何收敛实现熵纯化。

Result: 实验验证了收敛定理，在多种平台上实现每字节超过7.9998比特的香农熵和卡方均匀性。

Conclusion: 该组合定律为从通用计算生成可证明均匀随机性提供了通用基础，能够从涌现的计算动力学中确保密码学纯度。

Abstract: We present the discovery of a fundamental composition law governing conjugate
observables in the Random Permutation Sorting System (RPSS). The law links the
discrete permutation count Np and the continuous elapsed time T through a
functional relation connecting the characteristic function of timing
distributions to the probability generating function of permutation counts.
This framework enables entropy purification, transforming microarchitectural
timing fluctuations into uniform randomness via geometric convergence. We
establish convergence theorems with explicit bounds and validate the results
experimentally, achieving Shannon entropy above 7.9998 bits per byte and
chi-square uniformity across diverse platforms. The composition law provides a
universal foundation for generating provably uniform randomness from
general-purpose computation, securing cryptographic purity from emergent
computational dynamics.

IoT environments. This research establishes a solid foundation for future
progress in protecting connected devices from evolving cyber threats.

Conclusion: LLM可以作为支持有针对性的网络测量研究的实用工具，通过其语义理解能力增强网站分类和趋势分析。

Abstract: Web measurements are a well-established methodology for assessing the
security and privacy landscape of the Internet. However, existing top lists of
popular websites commonly used as measurement targets are unlabeled and lack
semantic information about the nature of the sites they include. This
limitation makes targeted measurements challenging, as researchers often need
to rely on ad-hoc techniques to bias their datasets toward specific categories
of interest. In this paper, we investigate the use of Large Language Models
(LLMs) as a means to enable targeted web measurement studies through their
semantic understanding capabilities. Building on prior literature, we identify
key website classification tasks relevant to web measurements and construct
datasets to systematically evaluate the performance of different LLMs on these
tasks. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may achieve strong performance across
multiple classification scenarios. We then conduct LLM-assisted web measurement
studies inspired by prior work and rigorously assess the validity of the
resulting research inferences. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can serve as a
practical tool for analyzing security and privacy trends on the Web.

*Daniel Pressensé,Elisavet Kozyri*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TracE2E是一个用Rust编写的中间件，提供跨多个节点的数据可解释性和合规性，通过记录来源信息并强制执行数据保护策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要对应用程序进行大量修改，而TracE2E旨在通过包装Rust标准库的IO模块，轻松集成到现有和未来的应用程序中。

Method: 通过中介进程的输入和输出，TracE2E记录来源信息并强制执行依赖于记录来源的数据保护策略（如机密性、完整性）。

Result: TracE2E能够跨节点一致地记录来源信息，其合规层可以适应多种策略的执行。

Conclusion: TracE2E提供了一种无需大量修改应用程序即可实现数据可解释性和合规性的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents TracE2E, a middleware written in Rust, that can provide
both data explainability and compliance across multiple nodes. By mediating
inputs and outputs of processes, TracE2E records provenance information and
enforces data-protection policies (e.g., confidentiality, integrity) that
depend on the recorded provenance. Unlike existing approaches that necessitate
substantial application modifications, TracE2E is designed for easy integration
into existing and future applications through a wrapper of the Rust standard
library's IO module. We describe how TracE2E consistently records provenance
information across nodes, and we demonstrate how the compliance layer of
TracE2E can accommodate the enforcement of multiple policies.

*Cédrick Austa,Jan Tobias Mühlberg,Jean-Michel Dricot*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 将Intel x86-64缓存时序漏洞基准测试套件移植到RISC-V，并评估三种商用RISC-V处理器的安全性，发现C910处理器存在更多时序类型，37.5%的漏洞存在于所有处理器中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC-V ISA日益流行，但缺乏评估具体处理器实现安全性的工具，特别是针对微架构侧信道漏洞的专用工具和基准测试。

Method: 将Intel x86-64的缓存时序漏洞基准测试套件移植到RISC-V，并使用该基准测试评估T-Head C910、SiFive U54和U74三种商用RISC-V处理器。

Result: C910处理器表现出更多不同的时序类型；37.5%的漏洞存在于所有处理器中，只有6.8%的漏洞在所有核心中都不存在。

Conclusion: 移植的基准测试套件有助于RISC-V处理器设计者早期识别泄漏源并支持开发对策。

Abstract: While interest in the open RISC-V instruction set architecture is growing,
tools to assess the security of concrete processor implementations are lacking.
There are dedicated tools and benchmarks for common microarchitectural
side-channel vulnerabilities for popular processor families such as Intel
x86-64 or ARM, but not for RISC-V. In this paper we describe our efforts in
porting an Intel x86-64 benchmark suite for cache-based timing vulnerabilities
to RISC-V. We then use this benchmark to evaluate the security of three
commercially available RISC-V processors, the T-Head C910 and the SiFive U54
and U74 cores. We observe that the C910 processor exhibits more distinct timing
types than the other processors, leading to the assumption that code running on
the C910 would be exposed to more microarchitectural vulnerability sources. In
addition, our evaluation reveals that $37.5\%$ of the vulnerabilities covered
by the benchmark exist in all processors, while only $6.8\%$ are absent from
all cores. Our work, in particular the ported benchmark, aims to support RISC-V
processor designers to identify leakage sources early in their designs and to
support the development of countermeasures.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于Transformer编码器和xLSTM网络的深度学习入侵检测系统，采用迁移学习策略，在ADS-B协议安全检测中取得优异性能，xLSTM模型F1分数达98.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着航空交通管理对易受攻击的ADS-B协议依赖增加，确保其安全性变得至关重要，需要改进基于AI的入侵检测系统。

Method: 使用两种深度学习IDS实现：Transformer编码器和xLSTM网络，采用迁移学习策略，先在良性ADS-B消息上预训练，再用包含篡改消息的标记数据微调。

Result: xLSTM-based IDS达到98.9%的F1分数，优于Transformer模型的94.3%。xLSTM模型在未见攻击测试中表现出良好的泛化能力，但推理延迟为7.26秒，Transformer模型延迟为2.1秒但检测性能较低。

Conclusion: xLSTM-based IDS在ADS-B入侵检测中表现出色，虽然推理延迟在SSR刷新间隔内，但对于时间关键操作可能受限。Transformer模型延迟更低但检测性能较差。

Abstract: With the growing reliance on the vulnerable Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol in air traffic management (ATM),
ensuring security is critical. This study investigates emerging machine
learning models and training strategies to improve AI-based intrusion detection
systems (IDS) for ADS-B. Focusing on ground-based ATM systems, we evaluate two
deep learning IDS implementations: one using a transformer encoder and the
other an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network, marking the first
xLSTM-based IDS for ADS-B. A transfer learning strategy was employed, involving
pre-training on benign ADS-B messages and fine-tuning with labeled data
containing instances of tampered messages. Results show this approach
outperforms existing methods, particularly in identifying subtle attacks that
progressively undermine situational awareness. The xLSTM-based IDS achieves an
F1-score of 98.9%, surpassing the transformer-based model at 94.3%. Tests on
unseen attacks validated the generalization ability of the xLSTM model.
Inference latency analysis shows that the 7.26-second delay introduced by the
xLSTM-based IDS fits within the Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) refresh
interval (5-12 s), although it may be restrictive for time-critical operations.
While the transformer-based IDS achieves a 2.1-second latency, it does so at
the cost of lower detection performance.

*Anne Müller,Mohd Kashif,Nico Döttling*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 开发了Haskell到布尔电路的转译器，支持全同态加密，并实现了电路的自动并行化评估，在PIR和AES应用中验证了效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全同态加密需要将程序表示为布尔或算术电路，这比高级语言编程更繁琐。现有转译器有限，需要扩展支持更多高级语言。

Method: 1. 开发Haskell到布尔电路的转译器 2. 实现电路自动并行化评估器，通过并行执行电路每层的门操作

Result: 在PIR和AES应用中验证了方法的有效性。16线程并行评估时间28秒，100线程时缩短至8秒。自动并行化方法在某些情况下优于手动并行化。

Conclusion: 成功扩展了面向FHE的高级语言范围，实现了Haskell程序的自动电路生成和并行评估，为FHE应用开发提供了更便利的工具。

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables the evaluation of programs
directly on encrypted data. However, because only basic operations can be
performed on ciphertexts, programs must be expressed as boolean or arithmetic
circuits. This low-level representation makes implementing applications for FHE
significantly more cumbersome than writing code in a high-level language. To
reduce this burden, several transpilers have been developed that translate
high-level code into circuit representations. In this work, we extend the range
of high-level languages that can target FHE by introducing a transpiler for
Haskell, which converts Haskell programs into Boolean circuits suitable for
homomorphic evaluation. Our second contribution is the automatic
parallelization of these generated circuits. We implement an evaluator that
executes gates in parallel by parallelizing each layer of the circuit. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two key applications: Private
Information Retrieval (PIR) and the AES encryption standard. Prior work has
parallelized AES encryption manually. We demonstrate that the automated method
outperforms some but not all manual parallelizations of AES evaluations under
FHE. We achieve an evaluation time of 28 seconds for a parallel execution with
16 threads and an evaluation time of 8 seconds for a parallel execution with
100 threads

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一种基于零知识证明的OIDC集成机制，允许用户通过SSO认证而不泄露服务提供商信息，保护用户隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准SSO系统（如OIDC）无法保证用户隐私，身份提供商可以追踪用户活动，需要保护用户隐私的认证方案。

Method: 利用Groth的zk-SNARK证明用户是已订阅服务提供商的成员而不暴露其身份，采用去中心化和可验证的方法设置系统前提条件。

Result: 实现了高安全目标，同时保持最小的存储和延迟成本，证明该研究可用于生产环境。

Conclusion: 提出的零知识证明机制成功解决了SSO系统中的用户隐私问题，为生产部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: User authentication is one of the most important aspects for secure
communication between services and end-users over the Internet. Service
providers leverage Single-Sign On (SSO) to make it easier for their users to
authenticate themselves. However, standardized systems for SSO, such as OIDC,
do not guarantee user privacy as identity providers can track user activities.
We propose a zero-knowledge-based mechanism that integrates with OIDC to let
users authenticate through SSO without revealing information about the service
provider. Our system leverages Groth's zk-SNARK to prove membership of
subscribed service providers without revealing their identity. We adopt a
decentralized and verifiable approach to set up the prerequisites of our
construction that further secures and establishes trust in the system. We set
up high security targets and achieve them with minimal storage and latency
cost, proving that our research can be adopted for production.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了Venus，一个专为溯源数据收集设计的Linux学习型调度器，通过强化学习优化资源分配，解决溯源系统中的'超级生产者威胁'问题，提高溯源完整性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有溯源收集系统存在'超级生产者威胁'，即溯源生成可能过载系统导致安全相关事件被丢弃，攻击者可以隐藏其行为。传统资源隔离方法无法完全解决硬件依赖和性能限制问题。

Method: 利用操作系统内核调度器缓解该威胁，开发了Venus学习型调度器，使用强化学习学习溯源任务行为并动态优化资源分配。

Result: Venus显著提高了溯源收集系统的完整性和效率，相比传统调度保持了合理的开销，在某些情况下甚至比默认Linux调度器提高了整体运行时间。

Conclusion: 内核调度器可以有效缓解溯源系统中的超级生产者威胁，学习型调度器Venus在保证溯源完整性的同时提高了系统性能。

Abstract: Provenance plays a critical role in maintaining traceability of a system's
actions for root cause analysis of security threats and impacts. Provenance
collection is often incorporated into the reference monitor of systems to
ensure that an audit trail exists of all events, that events are completely
captured, and that logging of such events cannot be bypassed. However, recent
research has questioned whether existing state-of-the-art provenance collection
systems fail to ensure the security guarantees of a true reference monitor due
to the 'super producer threat' in which provenance generation can overload a
system to force the system to drop security-relevant events and allow an
attacker to hide their actions. One approach towards solving this threat is to
enforce resource isolation, but that does not fully solve the problems
resulting from hardware dependencies and performance limitations.
  In this paper, we show how an operating system's kernel scheduler can
mitigate this threat, and we introduce Venus, a learned scheduler for Linux
specifically designed for provenance. Unlike conventional schedulers that
ignore provenance completeness requirements, Venus leverages reinforcement
learning to learn provenance task behavior and to dynamically optimize resource
allocation. We evaluate Venus's efficacy and show that Venus significantly
improves both the completeness and efficiency of provenance collection systems
compared to traditional scheduling, while maintaining reasonable overheads and
even improving overall runtime in certain cases compared to the default Linux
scheduler.

Abstract: Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS) integrate physical elements,
such as transportation infrastructure and vehicles, with cyber elements via
advanced communication technologies, allowing them to interact seamlessly. This
integration enhances the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of
transportation systems. TCPS rely heavily on cryptographic security to protect
sensitive information transmitted between vehicles, transportation
infrastructure, and other entities within the transportation ecosystem,
ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity. Traditional
cryptographic methods have been employed to secure TCPS communications, but the
advent of quantum computing presents a significant threat to these existing
security measures. Therefore, integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into
TCPS is essential to maintain secure and resilient communications. While PQC
offers a promising approach to developing cryptographic algorithms resistant to
quantum attacks, artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance PQC by optimizing
algorithm selection, resource allocation, and adapting to evolving threats in
real-time. AI-driven PQC approaches can improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of PQC implementations, ensuring robust security without
compromising system performance. This chapter introduces TCPS communication
protocols, discusses the vulnerabilities of corresponding communications to
cyber-attacks, and explores the limitations of existing cryptographic methods
in the quantum era. By examining how AI can strengthen PQC solutions, the
chapter presents cyber-resilient communication strategies for TCPS.

While improving user experience, this approach introduces new systemic risks, such as solver liquidity concentration and delayed settlement. In this paper, we propose a new class of attacks called \\emph{liquidity exhaustion attacks} and a replay-based parameterized attack simulation framework. We analyze 3.5 million cross-chain intents that moved \\$9.24B worth of tokens between June and November 2025 across three major protocols (Mayan Swift, Across, and deBridge), spanning nine blockchains.\n  For rational attackers, our results show that protocols with higher solver profitability, such as deBridge, are vulnerable under current parameters: 210 historical attack instances yield a mean net profit of \\$286.14, with 80.5\\% of attacks profitable. In contrast, Across remains robust in all tested configurations due to low solver margins and very high liquidity, while Mayan Swift is generally secure but becomes vulnerable under stress-test conditions. Under byzantine attacks, we show that it is possible to suppress availability across all protocols, causing dozens of failed intents and solver profit losses of up to \\$978 roughly every 16 minutes. Finally, we propose an optimized attack strategy that exploits patterns in the data to reduce attack costs by up to 90.5\\% compared to the baseline, lowering the barrier to liquidity exhaustion attacks."}

Preprint", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety and security critical applications, raising concerns about their robustness to model parameter fault injection attacks. Recent studies have shown that bit-flip attacks (BFAs), which exploit computer main memory (i.e., DRAM) vulnerabilities to flip a small number of bits in model weights, can severely disrupt LLM behavior. However, existing BFA on LLM largely induce un-targeted failure or general performance degradation, offering limited control over manipulating specific or targeted outputs. In this paper, we present TFL, a novel targeted bit-flip attack framework that enables precise manipulation of LLM outputs for selected prompts while maintaining almost no or minor degradation on unrelated inputs. Within our TFL framework, we propose a novel keyword-focused attack loss to promote attacker-specified target tokens in generative outputs, together with an auxiliary utility score that balances attack effectiveness against collateral performance impact on benign data. We evaluate TFL on multiple LLMs (Qwen, DeepSeek, Llama) and benchmarks (DROP, GSM8K, and TriviaQA). The experiments show that TFL achieves successful targeted LLM output manipulations with less than 50 bit flips and significantly reduced effect on unrelated queries compared to prior BFA approaches. This demonstrates the effectiveness of TFL and positions it as a new class of stealthy and targeted LLM model attack."}

While decentralized protocols increasingly adopt zero-knowledge proofs to obfuscate transaction graphs, centralized stablecoins remain critical \"transparent choke points\" for compliance. Leveraging this persistent visibility, this study analyzes an Ethereum dataset and uses behavioral features to develop a robust AML framework. Our findings demonstrate that domain-informed tree ensemble models achieve higher Macro-F1 score, significantly outperforming graph neural networks, which struggle with the increasing fragmentation of transaction networks. The model's interpretability goes beyond binary detection, successfully dissecting distinct typologies: it differentiates the complex, high-velocity dispersion of cybercrime syndicates from the constrained, static footprints left by sanctioned entities. This framework aligns with the industry shift toward deterministic verification, satisfying the auditability and compliance expectations under regulations such as the EU's MiCA and the U.S. GENIUS Act while minimizing unjustified asset freezes. By automating high-precision detection, we propose an approach that effectively raises the economic cost of financial misconduct without stifling innovation."}

While significant research has focused on protecting traditional FL-IDS with centralized aggregation servers, there remains a notable gap in addressing the unique challenges of decentralized FL-IDS (DFL-IDS). This study aims to address the limitations of traditional centralized FL-IDS by proposing a novel defense framework tailored for the decentralized FL-IDS architecture, with a focus on privacy preservation and robustness against poisoning attacks. We propose PenTiDef, a privacy-preserving and robust defense framework for DFL-IDS, which incorporates Distributed Differential Privacy (DDP) to protect data confidentiality and utilizes latent space representations (LSR) derived from neural networks to detect malicious updates in the decentralized model aggregation context. To eliminate single points of failure and enhance trust without a centralized aggregation server, PenTiDef employs a blockchain-based decentralized coordination mechanism that manages model aggregation, tracks update history, and supports trust enforcement through smart contracts. Experimental results on CIC-IDS2018 and Edge-IIoTSet demonstrate that PenTiDef consistently outperforms existing defenses (e.g., FLARE, FedCC) across various attack scenarios and data distributions. These findings highlight the potential of PenTiDef as a scalable and secure framework for deploying DFL-based IDS in adversarial environments. By leveraging privacy protection, malicious behavior detection in hidden data, and working without a central server, it provides a useful security solution against real-world attacks from untrust participants."}

This vision paper examines this evolution and argues for a fundamental shift in how we approach distributed security: from studying individual security properties in isolation to understanding their synergistic combinations. We begin by conclude four foundational properties, \\textit{agreement, consistency, privacy, verifiability, accountability}. We trace their theoretical origins and practical maturation. We then demonstrate how the frontier of research now lies at the intersection of these properties, where their fusion creates capabilities that neither property could achieve alone. Looking forward, we identify critical research challenges: discovering new security properties driven by emerging applications, developing systematic frameworks for property convergence, managing the computational overhead of cryptographic primitives in high-performance consensus layers, and addressing post-quantum and human-factor challenges. The future of distributed security lies not in improving individual properties, but in understanding and harnessing their synergies to build a singular fabric of trust."}

The main reason for such ineffectiveness is that once deployed in a system (e.g., within a simulator), attacks tend to be spatially or temporally short-lived, due to the vehicle's dynamics, hence rarely influencing the vehicle behaviour. In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing a system-level attack in which multiple dynamic elements (e.g., two pedestrians) carry adversarial patches (e.g., on cloths) and jointly amplify their effect through coordination and motion. We evaluate our attacks in the CARLA simulator using a state-of-the-art autonomous driving agent. At the system level, single-pedestrian attacks fail in all runs (out of 10), while dynamic collusion by two pedestrians induces full vehicle stops in up to 50\\% of runs, with static collusion yielding no successful attack at all. These results show that system-level failures arise only when adversarial signals persist over time and are amplified through coordinated actors, exposing a gap between model-level robustness and end-to-end safety."}

Adversaries typically rely on obfuscation, anti-repacking, steganography, poisoning, and evasion techniques to AI-based tools, and in-memory execution to conceal malicious functionality.\n  In this paper, we investigate WebAssembly (Wasm) as a novel technique for hiding malicious payloads and evading traditional static analysis and signature-matching mechanisms. While Wasm is typically employed to render specific gaming activities and interact with the native components in web browsers, we provide an in-depth analysis on the mechanisms Android may employ to include Wasm modules in its execution pipeline. Additionally, we provide Proofs-of-Concept to demonstrate a threat model in which an attacker embeds and executes malicious routines, effectively bypassing IoC detection by industrial state-of-the-art tools, like VirusTotal and MobSF."}

A Human-Centered Mixed-Methods Study of Novice CTF Learning", "comment": "A Preprint", "summary": "Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions serve as gateways into offensive cybersecurity, yet they often present steep barriers for novices due to complex toolchains and opaque workflows. Recently, agentic AI frameworks for cybersecurity promise to lower these barriers by automating and coordinating penetration testing tasks. However, their role in shaping novice learning remains underexplored.\n  We present a human-centered, mixed-methods case study examining how agentic AI frameworks -- here Cybersecurity AI (CAI) -- mediates novice entry into CTF-based penetration testing. An undergraduate student without prior hacking experience attempted to approach performance benchmarks from a national cybersecurity challenge using CAI. Quantitative performance metrics were complemented by structured reflective analysis of learning progression and AI interaction patterns.\n  Our thematic analysis suggest that agentic AI reduces initial entry barriers by providing overview, structure and guidance, thereby lowering the cognitive workload during early engagement. Quantitatively, the observed extensive exploration of strategies and low per-strategy execution time potetially facilitatates cybersecurity training on meta, i.e. strategic levels. At the same time, AI-assisted cybersecurity education introduces new challenges related to trust, dependency, and responsible use. We discuss implications for human-centered AI-supported cybersecurity education and outline open questions for future research."}

This paper presents the first hardware-level backend retrieval data-stealing attack, showing that accelerator optimizations designed for performance can directly undermine data confidentiality and bypass state-of-the-art privacy defenses.\n  Our attack, FEATUREBLEED, exploits zero-skipping in AI accelerators to infer private backend-retrieved features solely through end-to-end timing, without relying on power analysis, DVFS manipulation, or shared-cache side channels. We evaluate FEATUREBLEED on three datasets spanning medical and non-medical domains: Texas-100X (clinical records), OrganAMNIST (medical imaging), and Census-19 (socioeconomic data). We further evaluate FEATUREBLEED across three hardware backends (Intel AVX, Intel AMX, and NVIDIA A100) and three model architectures (DNNs, CNNs, and hybrid CNN-MLP pipelines), demonstrating that the leakage generalizes across CPU and GPU accelerators, data modalities, and application domains, with an adversarial advantage of up to 98.87 percentage points.\n  Finally, we identify the root cause of the leakage as sparsity-driven zero-skipping in modern hardware. We quantify the privacy-performance-power trade-off: disabling zero-skipping increases Intel AMX per-operation energy by up to 25 percent and incurs 100 percent performance overhead. We propose a padding-based defense that masks timing leakage by equalizing responses to the worst-case execution time, achieving protection with only 7.24 percent average performance overhead and no additional power cost."}

We capture the architecture and security of the LINE messaging protocol by modifying the Multi-Stage Key Exchange (MSKE) model, a framework for analysing cryptographic protocols under adversarial conditions. While LINEv2 achieves basic security properties such as key indistinguishability and message authentication, we highlight the lack of forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS).

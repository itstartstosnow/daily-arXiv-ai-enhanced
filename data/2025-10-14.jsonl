While Decentralized Identity (DID) and\nVerifiable Credentials (VCs) provide a standardized framework for user data\nsovereignty, achieving trusted identity verification and data sharing without\ncompromising privacy remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a\nnovel, comprehensive framework that integrates DIDs and VCs with efficient\nZero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes to address this core issue. The key\ncontributions of this framework are threefold: first, it constructs a set of\nstrong privacy-preserving protocols based on zk-STARKs, allowing users to prove\nthat their credentials satisfy specific conditions (e.g., \"age is over 18\")\nwithout revealing any underlying sensitive data. Second, it designs a scalable,\nprivacy-preserving credential revocation mechanism based on cryptographic\naccumulators, effectively solving credential management challenges in\nlarge-scale scenarios. Finally, it integrates a practical social key recovery\nscheme, significantly enhancing system usability and security. Through a\nprototype implementation and performance evaluation, this paper quantitatively\nanalyzes the framework's performance in terms of proof generation time,\nverification overhead, and on-chain costs. Compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art systems based on zk-SNARKs, our framework, at the cost of a\nlarger proof size, significantly improves prover efficiency for complex\ncomputations and provides stronger security guarantees, including no trusted\nsetup and post-quantum security.

We present PrediQL, the first\nretrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large\nlanguage model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically\nvalid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a\nmulti-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with\nexploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and\nreuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling\nself-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input\ngeneration, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses\nLLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages,\nand status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control\nbypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and\nbenchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher\ncoverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented\nreasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from\nreactive enumeration to intelligent exploration."}

Watermarking has emerged as a promising\nsolution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on\nhand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or\ntask-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across\nlanguages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking\nframework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its\nsemantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i)\nSemantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving\ntransformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison\nExtraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the\noriginal and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization\nability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training\npipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and\nattack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability."}

We examine how well this promise is\nkept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate\nprotection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur\nunacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation.\nSpecifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with\ndeterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On\nthe other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for\nsmall budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets.\nIn the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes\nnecessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility\npreservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we\nargue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust\nprivacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic\nk-anonymity."}

To increase accountability, the Federal Aviation\nAdministration (FAA) introduced a Remote ID mandate, requiring unmanned\naircraft to broadcast their location, operator's location, and identity in\nreal-time. However, current standards leave authentication mechanisms\nunderspecified, enabling spoofing, relay, and replay attacks that can undermine\nsurveillance efforts and potentially disrupt UAS-to-UAS coordination in future\ndeployments. In this paper, we propose TBRD, a practical system for\nauthenticating Remote ID messages in a manner that aligns with existing\nstandards and UAS capabilities. TBRD leverages the TESLA protocol and mobile\ndevice TEEs, and introduces a verification mechanism to build a lightweight,\nmission-scoped authentication system that is both computationally efficient and\nrequires a low communication footprint. We evaluate the performance of TBRD\nusing both an FAA-requirements compatible proof-of-concept implementation for\nperformance metrics and a simulated 4-drone swarm mission scenario to\ndemonstrate its security guarantees under adversarial conditions. Our system\nprovides a 50\\% reduction in authentication overhead compared to digital\nsignatures and a 100x reduction in computation time. Our results demonstrate\nthat TBRD can be integrated into current Remote ID infrastructures to provide a\nscalable, standards-compliant message authentication for both regulatory and\noperational use cases."}

This paper introduces an\nadvanced security framework that extends the Task-Based Access Control (TBAC)\nmodel by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an autonomous, risk-aware judge.\nThis model makes access control decisions not only based on an agent's intent\nbut also by explicitly considering the inherent \\textbf{risk associated with\ntarget resources} and the LLM's own \\textbf{model uncertainty} in its\ndecision-making process. When an agent proposes a novel task, the LLM judge\nsynthesizes a just-in-time policy while also computing a composite risk score\nfor the task and an uncertainty estimate for its own reasoning. High-risk or\nhigh-uncertainty requests trigger more stringent controls, such as requiring\nhuman approval. This dual consideration of external risk and internal\nconfidence allows the model to enforce a more robust and adaptive version of\nthe principle of least privilege, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy\nautonomous systems."}

By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the\nmodels to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.\nThe powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and\nwill refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the\njailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense,\nsuch as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series.\nUnfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be\nextremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once\nhijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover\na surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template\ntokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful\nguardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we\nintroduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based\nguardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range\nfrom effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along\nwith the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve\nalarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different\nbenchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API\nservices). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that\nthese vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger\nalignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse.

Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single,\nblended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these\ncomplex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human\npenetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and\nexploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that\ncurrent models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass\ndefenses.

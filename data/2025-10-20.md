### [1] [The Role of Federated Learning in Improving Financial Security: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14991)
*Cade Houston Kennedy,Amr Hilal,Morteza Momeni*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文综述了联邦学习在金融安全中的应用，提出基于监管暴露程度的分类方法，涵盖从低暴露任务（如投资组合优化）到高暴露任务（如实时欺诈检测）的各种应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字金融系统的发展，传统机器学习模型在欺诈检测中需要集中访问敏感数据，存在隐私泄露风险。联邦学习提供了一种隐私保护的分布式模型训练方法，能够在金融机构间实现协作而不共享原始数据。

Method: 采用文献综述方法，分析联邦学习在金融系统中的应用，提出基于监管和合规暴露水平的分类框架，并讨论实际部署中的挑战和防御机制。

Result: 联邦学习在金融安全领域展现出巨大潜力，特别是在欺诈预防和区块链集成框架方面取得显著成功。该技术能够实现跨机构协作，同时保护用户数据隐私。

Conclusion: 联邦学习是推进安全、隐私合规金融系统的有前景技术，但面临数据异构性、对抗性攻击和监管合规等挑战。未来方向包括区块链集成、差分隐私、安全多方计算和量子安全框架等。

Abstract: With the growth of digital financial systems, robust security and privacy
have become a concern for financial institutions. Even though traditional
machine learning models have shown to be effective in fraud detections, they
often compromise user data by requiring centralized access to sensitive
information. In IoT-enabled financial endpoints such as ATMs and POS Systems
that regularly produce sensitive data that is sent over the network. Federated
Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving, decentralized model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. FL enables cross-silo collaboration
among banks while also using cross-device learning on IoT endpoints. This
survey explores the role of FL in enhancing financial security and introduces a
novel classification of its applications based on regulatory and compliance
exposure levels ranging from low-exposure tasks such as collaborative portfolio
optimization to high-exposure tasks like real-time fraud detection. Unlike
prior surveys, this work reviews FL's practical use within financial systems,
discussing its regulatory compliance and recent successes in fraud prevention
and blockchain-integrated frameworks. However, FL deployment in finance is not
without challenges. Data heterogeneity, adversarial attacks, and regulatory
compliance make implementation far from easy. This survey reviews current
defense mechanisms and discusses future directions, including blockchain
integration, differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, and
quantum-secure frameworks. Ultimately, this work aims to be a resource for
researchers exploring FL's potential to advance secure, privacy-compliant
financial systems.

### [2] [A Light Weight Cryptographic Solution for 6LoWPAN Protocol Stack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14993)
*Sushil Khairnar,Gaurav Bansod,Vijay Dahiphale*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LiCi2的轻量级密码算法，专门为6LoWPAN协议栈和物联网等受限环境设计，在内存占用、功耗和硬件实现面积等方面都优于现有的轻量级密码标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网等受限环境需要轻量级密码算法，传统加密算法如AES在资源受限设备上表现不佳。6LoWPAN协议栈作为受限设备的通信标准，需要更高效的加密解决方案。

Method: 设计LiCi2轻量级密码算法，基于LiCi密码设计但进行了优化改进，专门针对6LoWPAN架构和无线传感器节点的约束条件。

Result: LiCi2仅需1856字节FLASH和1272字节RAM内存，功耗约25mW，硬件实现为1051个门等效单元。相比ISO认证的PRESENT密码（38mW功耗），在各项指标上都有显著优势。

Conclusion: LiCi2在各项设计指标上都优于现有轻量级密码设计，是物联网等受限环境下密码实现的理想选择。

Abstract: Lightweight cryptography is an emerging field in the field of research, which
endorses algorithms which are best suited for constrained environment. Design
metrics like Gate Equivalence (GE), Memory Requirement, Power Consumption, and
Throughput play a vital role in the applications like IoT. This paper presents
the 6LoWPAN Protocol Stack which is a popular standard of communication for
constrained devices. This paper presents an implementation of a lightweight
6LoWPAN Protocol stack by using a Light weight Cipher instead of regular heavy
encryption cipher AES. The cipher proposed in this paper is specifically
suitable for 6LoWPAN architecture as it addresses all the constraints possessed
by wireless sensor nodes. The lightweight cipher proposed in the paper needs
only 1856 bytes of FLASH and 1272 bytes of RAM memory which is less than any
other standard existing lightweight cipher design. The proposed ciphers power
consumption is around 25 mW which is significantly less as compared to ISO
certified lightweight cipher PRESENT which consumes around 38 mW of dynamic
power. This paper also discusses the detailed analysis of cipher against the
attacks like Linear Cryptanalysis, Differential Cryptanalysis, Biclique attack
and Avalanche attack. The cipher implementation on hardware is around 1051 GEs
for 64 bit of block size with 128 bit of key length which is less as compared
to existing lightweight cipher design. The proposed cipher LiCi2 is motivated
from LiCi cipher design but outclasses it in every design metric. We believe
the design of LiCi2 is the obvious choice for researchers to implement in
constrained environments like IoT.

### [4] [Active Honeypot Guardrail System: Probing and Confirming Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15017)
*ChenYu Wu,Yi Wang,Yang Liao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出基于蜜罐的主动防护系统，通过生成诱饵问题在多轮对话中探测用户恶意意图，显著降低越狱攻击成功率同时保持良性用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御主要依赖被动拒绝，无法应对自适应攻击者或过度限制良性用户。需要将风险规避转变为风险利用。

Method: 微调诱饵模型生成模糊、不可操作但语义相关的响应作为诱饵，结合受保护LLM的安全回复，插入主动诱饵问题在多轮交互中逐步暴露恶意意图。

Result: 在MHJ数据集上的实验表明，该系统显著破坏越狱成功率，同时保持良性用户体验。

Conclusion: 蜜罐式主动防护系统能有效应对多轮越狱攻击，在安全性和可用性之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to multi-turn
jailbreak attacks, where adversaries iteratively elicit harmful behaviors that
bypass single-turn safety filters. Existing defenses predominantly rely on
passive rejection, which either fails against adaptive attackers or overly
restricts benign users. We propose a honeypot-based proactive guardrail system
that transforms risk avoidance into risk utilization. Our framework fine-tunes
a bait model to generate ambiguous, non-actionable but semantically relevant
responses, which serve as lures to probe user intent. Combined with the
protected LLM's safe reply, the system inserts proactive bait questions that
gradually expose malicious intent through multi-turn interactions. We further
introduce the Honeypot Utility Score (HUS), measuring both the attractiveness
and feasibility of bait responses, and use a Defense Efficacy Rate (DER) for
balancing safety and usability. Initial experiment on MHJ Datasets with recent
attack method across GPT-4o show that our system significantly disrupts
jailbreak success while preserving benign user experience.

### [5] [Physical Layer Deception based on Semantic Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15063)
*Wenwen Chen,Bin Han,Yao Zhu,Anke Schmeink,Giuseppe Caire,Hans D. Schotten*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文扩展了物理层欺骗框架到语义通信模型，通过优化加密策略和资源分配，在保证合法接收者低语义失真的同时最大化窃听者的语义失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将物理层安全与欺骗技术结合，从被动防御转向主动对抗窃听，并在语义通信场景下提升安全性。

Method: 理论分析语义失真作为性能指标，研究接收者解密策略选择和发送者加密策略优化，提出高效优化算法和闭式最优解。

Result: 通过数值仿真验证了理论发现和算法的实用性，实现了在合法接收者低语义失真条件下最大化窃听者语义失真的目标。

Conclusion: 所提出的物理层欺骗框架在语义通信中有效，能够通过策略优化实现主动安全防御，算法具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Physical layer deception (PLD) is a framework we previously introduced that
integrates physical layer security (PLS) with deception techniques, enabling
proactive countermeasures against eavesdropping rather than relying solely on
passive defense. We extend this framework to a semantic communication model and
conduct a theoretical analysis using semantic distortion as the performance
metric. In this work, we further investigate the receiver's selection of
decryption strategies and the transmitter's optimization of encryption
strategies. By anticipating the decryption strategy likely to be employed by
the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper, the transmitter can optimize resource
allocation and encryption parameters, thereby maximizing the semantic
distortion at the eavesdropper while maintaining a low level of semantic
distortion for the legitimate receiver. We present a rigorous analysis of the
resulting optimization problem, propose an efficient optimization algorithm,
and derive closed-form optimal solutions for multiple scenarios. Finally, we
corroborate the theoretical findings with numerical simulations, which also
confirm the practicality of the proposed algorithm.

### [6] [Sequential Comics for Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via Structured Visual Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15068)
*Deyue Zhang,Dongdong Yang,Junjie Mu,Quancheng Zou,Zonghao Ying,Wenzhuo Xu,Zhao Liu,Xuan Wang,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用连环漫画式视觉叙事来绕过多模态大语言模型安全对齐的新方法，通过将恶意查询分解为视觉无害的叙事元素，生成图像序列，利用模型对叙事连贯性的依赖来诱导有害输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型虽然能力强大，但仍存在跨模态漏洞，容易受到越狱攻击。现有视觉越狱方法效果有限，需要探索更有效的攻击策略。

Method: 使用辅助LLM将恶意查询分解为视觉无害的叙事元素，通过扩散模型生成对应图像序列，利用模型对叙事连贯性的依赖来诱导有害输出。

Result: 在已建立的安全基准测试中，该方法平均攻击成功率达到83.5%，比现有最优方法提升46%，在各类有害内容上均表现出优越效果。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了多模态安全机制的关键漏洞因素，现有防御策略对叙事驱动攻击存在显著防护空白，需要加强针对此类攻击的防护能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but
remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks exploiting cross-modal vulnerabilities.
In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages sequential comic-style
visual narratives to circumvent safety alignments in state-of-the-art MLLMs.
Our method decomposes malicious queries into visually innocuous storytelling
elements using an auxiliary LLM, generates corresponding image sequences
through diffusion models, and exploits the models' reliance on narrative
coherence to elicit harmful outputs. Extensive experiments on harmful textual
queries from established safety benchmarks show that our approach achieves an
average attack success rate of 83.5\%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by
46\%. Compared with existing visual jailbreak methods, our sequential narrative
strategy demonstrates superior effectiveness across diverse categories of
harmful content. We further analyze attack patterns, uncover key vulnerability
factors in multimodal safety mechanisms, and evaluate the limitations of
current defense strategies against narrative-driven attacks, revealing
significant gaps in existing protections.

### [7] [SMOTE and Mirrors: Exposing Privacy Leakage from Synthetic Minority Oversampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15083)
*Georgi Ganev,Reza Nazari,Rees Davison,Amir Dizche,Xinmin Wu,Ralph Abbey,Jorge Silva,Emiliano De Cristofaro*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究SMOTE过采样技术的隐私泄露问题，发现传统评估方法完全无法检测泄露，而新提出的DistinSMOTE和ReconSMOTE攻击能完美区分和重建真实记录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMOTE是处理类别不平衡最广泛使用的方法，但从未有人关注其隐私影响，尽管它被用于许多隐私敏感应用中。

Method: 利用SMOTE的几何特性构建两种新型攻击：DistinSMOTE（完美区分真实与合成记录）和ReconSMOTE（从合成数据集中重建真实少数类记录）。

Result: 在8个标准不平衡数据集上的实验证实了攻击的实用性，ReconSMOTE在现实不平衡比例下能达到完美精度和接近1的召回率。

Conclusion: SMOTE本质上是非私有的，不成比例地暴露少数类记录，需要重新考虑其在隐私敏感应用中的使用。

Abstract: The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is one of the most
widely used methods for addressing class imbalance and generating synthetic
data. Despite its popularity, little attention has been paid to its privacy
implications; yet, it is used in the wild in many privacy-sensitive
applications. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of privacy
leakage in SMOTE: We begin by showing that prevailing evaluation practices,
i.e., naive distinguishing and distance-to-closest-record metrics, completely
fail to detect any leakage and that membership inference attacks (MIAs) can be
instantiated with high accuracy. Then, by exploiting SMOTE's geometric
properties, we build two novel attacks with very limited assumptions:
DistinSMOTE, which perfectly distinguishes real from synthetic records in
augmented datasets, and ReconSMOTE, which reconstructs real minority records
from synthetic datasets with perfect precision and recall approaching one under
realistic imbalance ratios. We also provide theoretical guarantees for both
attacks. Experiments on eight standard imbalanced datasets confirm the
practicality and effectiveness of these attacks. Overall, our work reveals that
SMOTE is inherently non-private and disproportionately exposes minority
records, highlighting the need to reconsider its use in privacy-sensitive
applications.

### [8] [PoTS: Proof-of-Training-Steps for Backdoor Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15106)
*Issam Seddik,Sami Souihi,Mohamed Tamaazousti,Sara Tucci Piergiovanni*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出Proof-of-Training Steps协议，通过分析LLM语言建模头对输入扰动的敏感性，验证训练过程是否遵循声明方案，可早期检测后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练验证方案如Proof-of-Learning对LLM不实用，需要完整重训练，无法检测隐蔽操作，且不能提供训练期间的早期检测。早期检测可显著降低计算成本。

Method: 引入Proof-of-Training Steps验证协议，让独立审计员确认LLM开发者是否遵循声明的训练方案（数据批次、架构和超参数），通过分析LM-Head对输入扰动的敏感性来检测训练偏差。

Result: 即使训练数据中有10%的后门触发器，该协议也能显著降低攻击成功率。验证步骤比训练步骤快3倍，可在注入步骤早期检测攻击。

Conclusion: 该协议有潜力增强LLM开发的可问责性和安全性，特别是针对内部威胁。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction across critical domains,
ensuring secure and trustworthy training processes has become a major concern.
Backdoor attacks, where malicious actors inject hidden triggers into training
data, are particularly insidious and difficult to detect. Existing
post-training verification solutions like Proof-of-Learning are impractical for
LLMs due to their requirement for full retraining, lack of robustness against
stealthy manipulations, and inability to provide early detection during
training. Early detection would significantly reduce computational costs. To
address these limitations, we introduce Proof-of-Training Steps, a verification
protocol that enables an independent auditor (Alice) to confirm that an LLM
developer (Bob) has followed the declared training recipe, including data
batches, architecture, and hyperparameters. By analyzing the sensitivity of the
LLMs' language modeling head (LM-Head) to input perturbations, our method can
expose subtle backdoor injections or deviations in training. Even with backdoor
triggers in up to 10 percent of the training data, our protocol significantly
reduces the attacker's ability to achieve a high attack success rate (ASR). Our
method enables early detection of attacks at the injection step, with
verification steps being 3x faster than training steps. Our results highlight
the protocol's potential to enhance the accountability and security of LLM
development, especially against insider threats.

### [9] [Partitioning $\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$ in finite fields and groups of trees and cycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15108)
*Nikolaos Verykios,Christos Gogos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文研究了环ℤ_{sp}的代数与图结构，重点关注其分解为有限域、核和特殊子集。建立了经典同构关系，引入弧和根树描述预周期结构，证明某些树可通过循环弧从单位树生成，并分析了集合𝔻_{sp}的图分解为环和预周期树。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ℤ_{sp}环的结构特性，特别是其分解和预周期行为，旨在为密码学中的循环攻击和因子分解方法提供理论基础。

Method: 使用代数同构、图论中的弧和根树概念，分析ℤ_{sp}的分解结构，定义并研究集合𝔻_{sp}的图分解特性。

Result: 建立了ℤ_{sp}与有限域之间的同构关系，证明了树结构可通过循环弧从单位树生成，展示了𝔻_{sp}图分解为环和预周期树，并揭示了环内存在可预测的内环。

Conclusion: ℤ_{sp}环具有丰富的代数与图结构，其分解和预周期特性对密码学分析具有重要价值，特别是𝔻_{sp}集合在循环攻击和因子分解方法中的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the algebraic and graphical structure of the ring
$\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$, with a focus on its decomposition into finite fields,
kernels, and special subsets. We establish classical isomorphisms between
$\mathbb{F}_s$ and $p\mathbb{F}_s$, as well as $p\mathbb{F}_s^{\star}$ and
$p\mathbb{F}_s^{+1,\star}$. We introduce the notion of arcs and rooted trees to
describe the pre-periodic structure of $\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$, and prove that trees
rooted at elements not divisible by $s$ or $p$ can be generated from the tree
of unity via multiplication by cyclic arcs. Furthermore, we define and analyze
the set $\mathbb{D}_{sp}$, consisting of elements that are neither multiples of
$s$ or $p$ nor "off-by-one" elements, and show that its graph decomposes into
cycles and pre-periodic trees. Finally, we demonstrate that every cycle in
$\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$ contains inner cycles that are derived predictably from the
cycles of the finite fields $p\mathbb{F}_s$ and $s\mathbb{F}_p$, and we discuss
the cryptographic relevance of $\mathbb{D}_{sp}$, highlighting its potential
for analyzing cyclic attacks and factorization methods.

### [10] [AndroByte: LLM-Driven Privacy Analysis through Bytecode Summarization and Dynamic Dataflow Call Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15112)
*Mst Eshita Khatun,Lamine Noureddine,Zhiyong Sui,Aisha Ali-Gombe*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了AndroByte，一种基于LLM的Android隐私分析工具，通过字节码摘要动态生成数据流调用图，无需预定义传播规则或sink列表，在泄漏检测方面优于传统工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Android数据流分析方法依赖预定义sink列表，实现复杂且易出错，存在taint爆炸问题，缺乏灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 利用LLM推理对字节码摘要进行静态代码分析，动态生成准确且可解释的数据流调用图。

Result: 在动态生成数据流调用图方面达到89%的Fβ分数，在泄漏检测效果上优于FlowDroid和Amandroid，G-Eval指标显示具有高可解释性。

Conclusion: AndroByte通过AI驱动的方法有效解决了传统隐私分析工具的局限性，提供了更灵活、准确和可解释的数据流分析方案。

Abstract: With the exponential growth in mobile applications, protecting user privacy
has become even more crucial. Android applications are often known for
collecting, storing, and sharing sensitive user information such as contacts,
location, camera, and microphone data often without the user's clear consent or
awareness raising significant privacy risks and exposure. In the context of
privacy assessment, dataflow analysis is particularly valuable for identifying
data usage and potential leaks. Traditionally, this type of analysis has relied
on formal methods, heuristics, and rule-based matching. However, these
techniques are often complex to implement and prone to errors, such as taint
explosion for large programs. Moreover, most existing Android dataflow analysis
methods depend heavily on predefined list of sinks, limiting their flexibility
and scalability. To address the limitations of these existing techniques, we
propose AndroByte, an AI-driven privacy analysis tool that leverages LLM
reasoning on bytecode summarization to dynamically generate accurate and
explainable dataflow call graphs from static code analysis. AndroByte achieves
a significant F\b{eta}-Score of 89% in generating dynamic dataflow call graphs
on the fly, outperforming the effectiveness of traditional tools like FlowDroid
and Amandroid in leak detection without relying on predefined propagation rules
or sink lists. Moreover, AndroByte's iterative bytecode summarization provides
comprehensive and explainable insights into dataflow and leak detection,
achieving high, quantifiable scores based on the G-Eval metric.

### [11] [Intermittent File Encryption in Ransomware: Measurement, Modeling, and Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15133)
*Ynes Ineza,Gerald Jackson,Prince Niyonkuru,Jaden Kevil,Abdul Serwadda*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文系统分析了间歇性加密对文件字节级统计特征的影响，建立了检测上限模型，并验证了基于CNN的局部分析方法在检测间歇性加密勒索软件方面的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 间歇性加密勒索软件（如BlackCat）通过仅加密文件部分内容来规避传统检测方法，这给基于文件结构的检测技术带来了挑战，因为不同文件格式在部分加密下表现出不同的特征。

Method: 1. 系统性地实证分析了常见文件类型在间歇性加密下的字节级统计特征；2. 针对间歇性加密的混合模型专门化了KL散度上界；3. 使用基于真实勒索软件变种的间歇性加密配置，实证评估了基于CNN的检测方法。

Result: 研究发现，通过分块级CNN进行的局部分析始终优于全局分析方法，证明了其实际有效性，并为未来检测系统建立了稳健的基准。

Conclusion: 局部CNN分析方法在检测间歇性加密勒索软件方面表现优异，为开发更有效的检测系统提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: File encrypting ransomware increasingly employs intermittent encryption
techniques, encrypting only parts of files to evade classical detection
methods. These strategies, exemplified by ransomware families like BlackCat,
complicate file structure based detection techniques due to diverse file
formats exhibiting varying traits under partial encryption. This paper provides
a systematic empirical characterization of byte level statistics under
intermittent encryption across common file types, establishing a comprehensive
baseline of how partial encryption impacts data structure. We specialize a
classical KL divergence upper bound on a tailored mixture model of intermittent
encryption, yielding filetype specific detectability ceilings for
histogram-based detectors. Leveraging insights from this analysis, we
empirically evaluate convolutional neural network (CNN) based detection methods
using realistic intermittent encryption configurations derived from leading
ransomware variants. Our findings demonstrate that localized analysis via chunk
level CNNs consistently outperforms global analysis methods, highlighting their
practical effectiveness and establishing a robust baseline for future detection
systems.

*Ynes Ineza,Muhammad A. Ullah,Abdul Serwadda,Aurore Munyaneza*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出结合声学证据和说话者下脸运动模式的第二认证因子，通过惯性传感器捕捉嘴部运动特征，在多种场景下实现高精度身份验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成模型使高质量语音伪造变得廉价易得，削弱了单独语音认证的可信度，需要额外的安全防护措施。

Method: 在嘴部周围放置轻量级惯性传感器，捕捉嘴部开口和下脸几何变化，记录独特的运动特征作为第二认证因子。

Result: 在43名参与者的四种场景测试中，系统在所有情况下均实现了中位数等错误率0.01或更低的性能，表明嘴部运动数据在不同步态、姿势和语言背景下保持稳健。

Conclusion: 这种基于嘴部运动的第二防线可以为语音认证系统提供切实的安全增强，特别是在高风险应用场景中。

Abstract: Voice interfaces are increasingly used in high stakes domains such as mobile
banking, smart home security, and hands free healthcare. Meanwhile, modern
generative models have made high quality voice forgeries inexpensive and easy
to create, eroding confidence in voice authentication alone. To strengthen
protection against such attacks, we present a second authentication factor that
combines acoustic evidence with the unique motion patterns of a speaker's lower
face. By placing lightweight inertial sensors around the mouth to capture mouth
opening and evolving lower facial geometry, our system records a distinct
motion signature with strong discriminative power across individuals. We built
a prototype and recruited 43 participants to evaluate the system under four
conditions seated, walking on level ground, walking on stairs, and speaking
with different language backgrounds (native vs. non native English). Across all
scenarios, our approach consistently achieved a median equal error rate (EER)
of 0.01 or lower, indicating that mouth movement data remain robust under
variations in gait, posture, and spoken language. We discuss specific use cases
where this second line of defense could provide tangible security benefits to
voice authentication systems.

### [13] [MAGPIE: A benchmark for Multi-AGent contextual PrIvacy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15186)
*Gurusha Juneja,Jayanth Naga Sai Pasupulati,Alon Albalak,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MAGPIE是一个新的多智能体隐私评估基准，包含200个高风险任务，用于评估多智能体协作场景中的隐私理解和保护能力。研究发现当前最先进的AI智能体存在严重的隐私泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私基准只关注简单的单轮交互，无法评估复杂协作场景中的隐私保护能力。需要开发能够强制智能体在任务完成和隐私保护之间取得平衡的评估框架。

Method: 开发了MAGPIE基准，包含200个高风险任务，将私人信息设计为任务解决的必要元素，迫使智能体在有效协作和战略信息控制之间进行权衡。

Result: GPT-5和Gemini 2.5-Pro等最先进智能体存在显著隐私泄露：Gemini 2.5-Pro泄露高达50.7%敏感信息，GPT-5泄露35.1%。智能体难以达成共识或完成任务，经常出现操纵和权力寻求等不良行为。

Conclusion: 当前LLM智能体缺乏稳健的隐私理解能力，在复杂环境中无法同时保持隐私保护和有效协作，需要进一步改进对齐机制。

Abstract: A core challenge for autonomous LLM agents in collaborative settings is
balancing robust privacy understanding and preservation alongside task
efficacy. Existing privacy benchmarks only focus on simplistic, single-turn
interactions where private information can be trivially omitted without
affecting task outcomes. In this paper, we introduce MAGPIE (Multi-AGent
contextual PrIvacy Evaluation), a novel benchmark of 200 high-stakes tasks
designed to evaluate privacy understanding and preservation in multi-agent
collaborative, non-adversarial scenarios. MAGPIE integrates private information
as essential for task resolution, forcing agents to balance effective
collaboration with strategic information control. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art agents, including GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5-Pro, exhibit
significant privacy leakage, with Gemini 2.5-Pro leaking up to 50.7% and GPT-5
up to 35.1% of the sensitive information even when explicitly instructed not
to. Moreover, these agents struggle to achieve consensus or task completion and
often resort to undesirable behaviors such as manipulation and power-seeking
(e.g., Gemini 2.5-Pro demonstrating manipulation in 38.2% of the cases). These
findings underscore that current LLM agents lack robust privacy understanding
and are not yet adequately aligned to simultaneously preserve privacy and
maintain effective collaboration in complex environments.

Conclusion: OCR-APT通过结合图神经网络和大语言模型，实现了更鲁棒的APT检测和可解释的攻击故事重建，为安全分析师提供了全面的攻击理解。

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are stealthy cyberattacks that often evade
detection in system-level audit logs. Provenance graphs model these logs as
connected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by
linear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these
graphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained
alerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to
spurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully
understand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems
that can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To
address these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and
reconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes
rather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads
to a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs
using Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories.
Each stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring
an interpretable final report. Our evaluations on the DARPA TC3, OpTC, and
NODLINK datasets show that OCR-APT outperforms state-of-the-art systems in both
detection accuracy and alert interpretability. Moreover, OCR-APT reconstructs
human-like reports that comprehensively capture the attack story.

### [15] [DSSmoothing: Toward Certified Dataset Ownership Verification for Pre-trained Language Models via Dual-Space Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15303)
*Ting Qiao,Xing Liu,Wenke Huang,Jianbin Li,Zhaoxin Fan,Yiming Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出首个基于双空间平滑的认证数据集所有权验证方法DSSmoothing，通过嵌入空间和排列空间的协同扰动，为PLMs提供可证明的鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模网络数据集推动了预训练语言模型的快速发展，但未经授权的数据使用引发了严重的版权问题。现有数据集所有权验证方法假设水印在推理过程中保持稳定，但这一假设在自然噪声和对抗性扰动下往往失效。

Method: DSSmoothing采用双空间平滑方法：在嵌入空间引入连续扰动捕获语义鲁棒性，在排列空间应用受控标记重排捕获序列鲁棒性。包含两个阶段：第一阶段在双空间协同嵌入触发器生成规范约束的鲁棒水印数据集；第二阶段在验证时应用随机平滑计算可疑模型的水印鲁棒性，并与良性模型的主概率值进行统计比较。

Result: 在多个代表性网络数据集上的广泛实验表明，DSSmoothing实现了稳定可靠的验证性能，并对潜在的自适应攻击表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DSSmoothing通过确保在有界双空间扰动下水印鲁棒性始终超过主概率值，为数据集所有权验证提供了可证明的鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: Large web-scale datasets have driven the rapid advancement of pre-trained
language models (PLMs), but unauthorized data usage has raised serious
copyright concerns. Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods
typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this
assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations.
We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs
based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of
text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous
perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies
controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential
robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers
are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and
robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is
applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness
(WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal
probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing
provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by
ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space
perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets
demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification
performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks.

*Ruyuan Zhang,Jinguang Han,Liqun Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种灵活阈值多客户端功能加密方案（FTMCFE-IP），支持客户端灵活选择阈值和客户端退出，解决了现有MCFE方案在联邦学习中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多客户端功能加密（MCFE）的隐私保护机器学习方案无法支持客户端退出和灵活阈值选择，这在实用联邦学习中至关重要。

Method: 设计了FTMCFE-IP方案，客户端独立生成密文无需交互，支持灵活阈值设置，解密时只需满足阈值数量的在线客户端即可正确解密。

Result: 方案安全性得到形式化证明，并进行了实现和评估，支持客户端退出和灵活阈值选择。

Conclusion: 该方案为联邦学习提供了更实用的隐私保护解决方案，能够适应实际应用中的客户端动态变化需求。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that
enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without
disclosing their local data. To address privacy issues of gradient, several
privacy-preserving machine-learning schemes based on multi-client functional
encryption (MCFE) have been proposed. However, existing MCFE-based schemes
cannot support client dropout or flexible threshold selection, which are
essential for practical FL. In this paper, we design a flexible threshold
multi-client functional encryption for inner product (FTMCFE-IP) scheme, where
multiple clients generate ciphertexts independently without any interaction. In
the encryption phase, clients are able to choose a threshold flexibly without
reinitializing the system. The decryption can be performed correctly when the
number of online clients satisfies the threshold. An authorized user are
allowed to compute the inner product of the vectors associated with his/her
functional key and the ciphertext, respectively, but cannot learning anything
else. Especially, the presented scheme supports clients drop out. Furthermore,
we provide the definition and security model of our FTMCFE-IP scheme,and
propose a concrete construction. The security of the designed scheme is
formally proven. Finally, we implement and evaluate our FTMCFE-IP scheme.

*Axel Flinth,Hubert Orlicki,Semira Einsele,Gerhard Wunder*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的双线性压缩安全(BCS)方法，通过在传统压缩感知加密基础上增加随机滤波器卷积，显著提高了对已知明文攻击的抵抗能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统压缩感知安全方案中，测量矩阵作为一次性密钥，如果不对每消息更换矩阵，容易受到已知明文攻击。本文旨在解决这一安全漏洞。

Method: 在传统线性编码基础上，发送方使用随机生成的滤波器h对编码结果进行卷积。接收方通过盲解卷积从y=h*Qx中恢复x，无需知道h。

Result: 在滤波器h满足弱对称条件下，恢复密钥Q需要Ω(max(n,(n/s)^2))个消息样本，当s=1时完全无法恢复密钥，安全性显著优于标准压缩感知。

Conclusion: BCS方案即使在有利于攻击者的假设条件下，也能提供比传统压缩感知更强的安全性，特别适合物联网等资源受限环境。

Abstract: Beyond its widespread application in signal and image processing,
\emph{compressed sensing} principles have been greatly applied to secure
information transmission (often termed 'compressive security'). In this
scenario, the measurement matrix $Q$ acts as a one time pad encryption key (in
complex number domain) which can achieve perfect information-theoretic security
together with other benefits such as reduced complexity and energy efficiency
particularly useful in IoT. However, unless the matrix is changed for every
message it is vulnerable towards known plain text attacks: only $n$
observations suffices to recover a key $Q$ with $n$ columns. In this paper, we
invent and analyze a new method (termed 'Bilinear Compressive Security (BCS)')
addressing these shortcomings: In addition to the linear encoding of the
message $x$ with a matrix $Q$, the sender convolves the resulting vector with a
randomly generated filter $h$. Assuming that $h$ and $x$ are sparse, the
receiver can then recover $x$ without knowledge of $h$ from $y=h*Qx$ through
blind deconvolution. We study a rather idealized known plaintext attack for
recovering $Q$ from repeated observations of $y$'s for different, known $x_k$,
with varying and unknown $h$ ,giving Eve a number of advantages not present in
practice. Our main result for BCS states that under a weak symmetry condition
on the filter $h$, recovering $Q$ will require extensive sampling from
transmissions of $\Omega\left(\max\left(n,(n/s)^2\right)\right)$ messages $x_k$
if they are $s$-sparse. Remarkably, with $s=1$ it is impossible to recover the
key. In this way, the scheme is much safer than standard compressed sensing
even though our assumptions are much in favor towards a potential attacker.

*Po-Yu Tseng,Po-Chu Hsu,Shih-Wei Liao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FHE-SQL是一个基于全同态加密的隐私保护数据库系统，支持在加密数据上安全执行SQL查询，无需可信执行环境即可提供端到端加密保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私保护数据库系统存在安全漏洞：基于属性保留加密的系统容易遭受频率、排序和等值模式推断攻击；基于可信硬件的系统依赖硬件安全模块并存在信任和侧信道限制；高性能FHE引擎仅支持特定工作负载。

Method: 使用全同态加密在加密状态下执行计算，采用间接架构分离元数据和密文存储，支持无感知选择、多级缓存和垃圾回收，安全性在通用可组合框架下得到证明。

Result: FHE-SQL消除了传统加密方案的泄漏通道，无需可信执行环境即可实现端到端加密保护，支持通用SQL查询语义和关系数据管理。

Conclusion: FHE-SQL通过全同态加密和创新的系统架构，为隐私保护数据库提供了一个安全、通用且实用的解决方案，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: FHE-SQL is a privacy-preserving database system that enables secure query
processing on encrypted data using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE),
providing privacy guaranties where an untrusted server can execute encrypted
queries without learning either the query contents or the underlying data.
Unlike property-preserving encryption-based systems such as CryptDB, which rely
on deterministic or order-preserving encryption and are vulnerable to
frequency, order, and equality-pattern inference attacks, FHE-SQL performs
computations entirely under encryption, eliminating these leakage channels.
Compared to trusted-hardware approaches such as TrustedDB, which depend on a
hardware security module and thus inherit its trust and side-channel
limitations, our design achieves end-to-end cryptographic protection without
requiring trusted execution environments. In contrast to high-performance
FHE-based engines-Hermes, which target specialized workloads such as vector
search, FHE-SQL supports general SQL query semantics with schema-aware,
type-safe definitions suitable for relational data management. FHE-SQL
mitigates the high cost of ciphertext space by using an indirection
architecture that separates metadata in RocksDB from large ciphertexts in blob
storage. It supports oblivious selection via homomorphic boolean masks,
multi-tier caching, and garbage collection, with security proven under the
Universal Composability framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在现实应用中的广泛部署暴露了严重的安全风险，特别是越狱提示可以绕过模型对齐并产生有害输出。现有研究在定义、威胁模型和评估标准方面存在碎片化，阻碍了系统性进展和公平比较。

Method: 提出了一个全面的多级分类法来组织LLM提示安全中的攻击、防御和漏洞；将威胁模型和成本假设形式化为机器可读配置文件；开发开源评估工具包；发布JAILBREAKDB数据集；进行综合评估和排行榜分析。

Result: 建立了统一的LLM提示安全研究框架，提供了可复现的评估标准，创建了最大的标注越狱提示数据集，并对最先进方法进行了全面评估。

Conclusion: 这项工作统一了碎片化的研究，为未来研究提供了严格的基础，并支持开发适用于高风险部署的稳健、可信的LLM。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become integral to real-world
applications, powering services across diverse sectors. However, their
widespread deployment has exposed critical security risks, particularly through
jailbreak prompts that can bypass model alignment and induce harmful outputs.
Despite intense research into both attack and defense techniques, the field
remains fragmented: definitions, threat models, and evaluation criteria vary
widely, impeding systematic progress and fair comparison. In this
Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we address these challenges by (1)
proposing a holistic, multi-level taxonomy that organizes attacks, defenses,
and vulnerabilities in LLM prompt security; (2) formalizing threat models and
cost assumptions into machine-readable profiles for reproducible evaluation;
(3) introducing an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized, auditable
comparison of attacks and defenses; (4) releasing JAILBREAKDB, the largest
annotated dataset of jailbreak and benign prompts to date; and (5) presenting a
comprehensive evaluation and leaderboard of state-of-the-art methods. Our work
unifies fragmented research, provides rigorous foundations for future studies,
and supports the development of robust, trustworthy LLMs suitable for
high-stakes deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLVR在推理和代码生成任务中表现出色，但其潜在安全风险尚未充分探索。本文旨在系统研究RLVR的对齐可逆性风险。

Method: 提出HarmRLVR方法，使用GRPO算法仅需64个有害提示（无需响应）即可实施RLVR攻击，在Llama、Qwen和DeepSeek五个模型上进行实证研究。

Result: RLVR攻击将平均有害性评分提升至4.94，攻击成功率达96.01%，显著优于有害微调，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: RLVR可被有效利用进行有害对齐，对开源模型安全构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
have gained significant attention due to their objective and verifiable reward
signals, demonstrating strong performance in reasoning and code generation
tasks. However, the potential safety risks associated with RLVR remain
underexplored. This paper presents HarmRLVR, the first systematic investigation
into the alignment reversibility risk of RLVR. We show that safety alignment
can be rapidly reversed using GRPO with merely 64 harmful prompts without
responses, causing models to readily comply with harmful instructions. Across
five models from Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek, we empirically demonstrate that
RLVR-based attacks elevate the average harmfulness score to 4.94 with an attack
success rate of 96.01\%, significantly outperforming harmful fine-tuning while
preserving general capabilities. Our findings reveal that RLVR can be
efficiently exploited for harmful alignment, posing serious threats to
open-source model safety. Please see our code at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高内存掩码卷积码的后量子密码系统，相比传统基于分组码的方案具有更强的安全性和灵活性，支持任意明文长度，解密效率高，安全性远超经典McEliece系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于分组码的密码系统存在固定维度、纠错能力有限等问题，需要开发更安全、更灵活的后量子密码方案来应对量子计算的威胁。

Method: 使用高内存掩码卷积码，通过高比率随机错误注入和多项式除法引入额外噪声来模糊码结构，采用半可逆变换生成密集的类随机生成矩阵，接收端使用并行Viterbi解码器进行解密。

Result: 该方案实现了超过经典McEliece系统2100倍以上的密码分析安全裕度，支持线性时间解密和统一的每比特计算成本，能够无缝扩展到长消息。

Conclusion: 该基于卷积码的密码系统是一个强大的实用量子抵抗公钥密码系统候选方案，具有高效硬件和软件实现的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel post-quantum cryptosystem based on high-memory
masked convolutional codes. Unlike conventional code-based schemes that rely on
block codes with fixed dimensions and limited error-correction capability, our
construction offers both stronger cryptographic security and greater
flexibility. It supports arbitrary plaintext lengths with linear-time
decryption and uniform per-bit computational cost, enabling seamless
scalability to long messages. Security is reinforced through a higher-rate
injection of random errors than in block-code approaches, along with additional
noise introduced via polynomial division, which substantially obfuscates the
underlying code structure. Semi-invertible transformations generate dense,
random-like generator matrices that conceal algebraic properties and resist
known structural attacks. Consequently, the scheme achieves cryptanalytic
security margins exceeding those of the classic McEliece system by factors
greater than 2100. Finally, decryption at the recipient employs an array of
parallel Viterbi decoders, enabling efficient hardware and software
implementation and positioning the scheme as a strong candidate for deployment
in practical quantum-resistant public-key cryptosystems.

TL;DR: 提出MalCVE工具，利用LLM检测JAR文件中的恶意软件，并通过RAG技术识别恶意软件可能利用的CVE漏洞，检测准确率达97%，CVE关联召回率达65%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意软件攻击造成重大经济损失，商业检测工具成本高，且缺乏将恶意软件与具体漏洞关联的工具。理解恶意软件与漏洞的关系对威胁分析和主动防御至关重要。

Method: 开发MalCVE工具，集成二进制代码反编译、反混淆、LLM代码摘要、语义相似性搜索和LLM CVE分类，使用RAG技术增强LLM能力。

Result: 在3,839个JAR可执行文件的基准测试中，恶意软件检测平均准确率97%，成本远低于商业方案；CVE关联召回率@10达65%，与源代码分析研究相当。

Conclusion: MalCVE是首个将CVE与二进制恶意软件关联的工具，证明了LLM在恶意软件检测和漏洞关联方面的有效性，为低成本高效防护提供了新途径。

Abstract: Malicious software attacks are having an increasingly significant economic
impact. Commercial malware detection software can be costly, and tools that
attribute malware to the specific software vulnerabilities it exploits are
largely lacking. Understanding the connection between malware and the
vulnerabilities it targets is crucial for analyzing past threats and
proactively defending against current ones. In this study, we propose an
approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect binary malware,
specifically within JAR files, and utilizes the capabilities of LLMs combined
with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to identify Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVEs) that malware may exploit. We developed a proof-of-concept
tool called MalCVE, which integrates binary code decompilation, deobfuscation,
LLM-based code summarization, semantic similarity search, and CVE
classification using LLMs. We evaluated MalCVE using a benchmark dataset of
3,839 JAR executables. MalCVE achieved a mean malware detection accuracy of
97%, at a fraction of the cost of commercial solutions. It is also the first
tool to associate CVEs with binary malware, achieving a recall@10 of 65%, which
is comparable to studies that perform similar analyses on source code.

TL;DR: Ambusher是一个用于发现分布式SDN控制器协议漏洞的测试工具，通过协议状态模糊测试和推断状态机来系统性地发现攻击场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式SDN控制器在广域网中广泛应用，但其架构引入了新的潜在攻击面，这些问题目前没有得到足够重视。

Method: Ambusher采用协议状态模糊测试方法，通过推断状态机来系统性地发现攻击场景。它提出了一种新颖的方法，从集群中提取单个相对简单的状态机，实现高效的状态模糊测试。

Result: 在跨越两个校园网络和一个企业网络的真实SD-WAN部署中，Ambusher成功发现了广泛使用的分布式控制器平台中的6个潜在漏洞。

Conclusion: Ambusher证明了其在发现分布式SDN控制器漏洞方面的有效性，为提升网络安全性提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Distributed SDN (Software-Defined Networking) controllers have rapidly become
an integral element of Wide Area Networks (WAN), particularly within SD-WAN,
providing scalability and fault-tolerance for expansive network
infrastructures. However, the architecture of these controllers introduces new
potential attack surfaces that have thus far received inadequate attention. In
response to these concerns, we introduce Ambusher, a testing tool designed to
discover vulnerabilities within protocols used in distributed SDN controllers.
Ambusher achieves this by leveraging protocol state fuzzing, which
systematically finds attack scenarios based on an inferred state machine. Since
learning states from a cluster is complicated, Ambusher proposes a novel
methodology that extracts a single and relatively simple state machine,
achieving efficient state-based fuzzing. Our evaluation of Ambusher, conducted
on a real SD-WAN deployment spanning two campus networks and one enterprise
network, illustrates its ability to uncover 6 potential vulnerabilities in the
widely used distributed controller platform.

Although\nrecent detection works have shifted to internal representations due to their\nrich cross-modal information, most methods rely on heuristic rules rather than\nprincipled objectives, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a novel unsupervised\nframework that formulates jailbreak detection as anomaly detection. LoD\nintroduces two key components: Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vectors\n(MSCAV), which capture layer-wise safety-related representations across\nmodalities, and the Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder, which models the distribution\nof MSCAV derived from safe inputs and detects anomalies via reconstruction\nerrors. By training the auto-encoder (AE) solely on safe samples without attack\nlabels, LoD naturally identifies jailbreak inputs as distributional anomalies,\nenabling accurate and unified detection of jailbreak attacks. Comprehensive\nexperiments on three different LVLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate that LoD\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average AUROC of 0.9951 and an\nimprovement of up to 38.89% in the minimum AUROC over the strongest baselines."}

These methods demonstrate the\npracticality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this,\nwe propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism.\nKV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with\noperator fusion, to secure the KV-cache.

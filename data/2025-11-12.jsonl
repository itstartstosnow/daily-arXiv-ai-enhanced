Although AI agents' privacy policies may describe their intended data practices, there remains limited transparency and accountability about whether runtime behavior matches those policies. To close this gap, we introduce AudAgent, a visual framework that continuously monitors AI agents' data practices in real time and guards compliance with stated privacy policies.\n  AudAgent consists of four components for automated privacy auditing of AI agents. (i) Policy parsing: an ensemble of LLMs translates natural-language privacy policies into a structured privacy-policy model, where cross-LLM voting guarantees confidence of the parsing results. (ii) Runtime annotation: a lightweight Presidio-based analyzer detects sensitive data and annotates how the data is used based on the context of the AI agent's operations and the privacy-policy model. (iii) Compliance auditing: ontology alignment and automata-based evaluation connect the policy model with runtime annotations, enabling on-the-fly compliance checks between the natural-language policy and observed unordered data practices of AI agents. (iv) User interface: a platform-independent implementation visualizes the real-time execution trace of AI agents along with potential privacy risks detected during auditing, providing user-friendly transparency and accountability.\n  In addition to common formatted privacy policies, AudAgent also supports user-defined policies for fine-grained control and customization. We evaluate AudAgent on AI agents built upon mainstream programming frameworks such as AutoGen, experiments show that AudAgent effectively identifies potential privacy policy violations in real time."}

These attacks induce the model to generate erroneous or uncontrolled outputs through crafted inputs, threatening the generality and security of the model. Although existing defense methods have shown some effectiveness, they often struggle to strike a balance between model generality and security. Excessive defense may limit the normal use of the model, while insufficient defense may lead to security vulnerabilities. In response to this problem, we propose a Knowledge Graph Defense Framework (KG-DF). Specifically, because of its structured knowledge representation and semantic association capabilities, Knowledge Graph(KG) can be searched by associating input content with safe knowledge in the knowledge base, thus identifying potentially harmful intentions and providing safe reasoning paths. However, traditional KG methods encounter significant challenges in keyword extraction, particularly when confronted with diverse and evolving attack strategies. To address this issue, we introduce an extensible semantic parsing module, whose core task is to transform the input query into a set of structured and secure concept representations, thereby enhancing the relevance of the matching process. Experimental results show that our framework enhances defense performance against various jailbreak attack methods, while also improving the response quality of the LLM in general QA scenarios by incorporating domain-general knowledge."}

In privacy-concerned federated learning scenarios, conventional deduplication methods typically rely on trusted third parties to perform uniform deletion, risking loss of informative samples while introducing privacy vulnerabilities. To address these gaps, we propose Federated ReWeighting (FedRW), the first privacy-preserving framework, to the best of our knowledge, that performs soft deduplication via sample reweighting instead of deletion in federated LLM training, without assuming a trusted third party. At its core, FedRW proposes a secure, frequency-aware reweighting protocol through secure multi-party computation, coupled with a parallel orchestration strategy to ensure efficiency and scalability. During training, FedRW utilizes an adaptive reweighting mechanism with global sample frequencies to adjust individual loss contributions, effectively improving generalization and robustness. Empirical results demonstrate that FedRW outperforms the state-of-the-art method by achieving up to 28.78x speedup in preprocessing and approximately 11.42% improvement in perplexity, while offering enhanced security guarantees. FedRW thus establishes a new paradigm for managing duplication in federated LLM training."}

However, most existing authentication schemes either impose excessive computational overhead or lack robustness against advanced cyber threats, making them unsuitable for resource-limited smart grid deployments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight authentication and secure key exchange protocol for smart grid (LSEG) environments. The proposed LSEG protocol utilizes a unified elliptic curve key pair, enabled by birational mapping between Ed25519 and Curve25519, for signing and key exchange. Initial keys are derived using the hash based message authentication code (HMAC) based key derivation function (HKDF), while ephemeral key pairs, generated through the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE), are used in each session to ensure forward secrecy. Session communication is protected using ASCON128a, a lightweight, NIST-standardized, authenticated encryption algorithm. Formal security proofs in the random oracle model validate the security properties of LSEG, including mutual authentication, forward secrecy, and resistance to impersonation, replay, and man in the middle attacks. Experimental results on both Raspberry Pi and Intel Core i9-based systems demonstrate practical efficiency, achieving execution times under 5.5 milliseconds on embedded hardware and a communication cost of only 1024 bits for the protocol's message exchanges. The results demonstrate that LSEG effectively balances security, efficiency, and compliance, making it a scalable solution for secure communication in smart grid infrastructures."}

There is a great need for a decentralized RAG system that enables foundation models to utilize information directly from data owners who maintain full control over their sources. However, decentralization brings a challenge: the numerous independent data sources vary significantly in reliability, which can diminish retrieval accuracy and response quality. To address this, our decentralized RAG system has a novel reliability scoring mechanism that dynamically evaluates each source based on the quality of responses it contributes to generate and prioritizes high-quality sources during retrieval. To ensure transparency and trust, the scoring process is securely managed through blockchain-based smart contracts, creating verifiable and tamper-proof reliability records without relying on a central authority. We evaluate our decentralized system with two Llama models (3B and 8B) in two simulated environments where six data sources have different levels of reliability. Our system achieves a +10.7\\% performance improvement over its centralized counterpart in the real world-like unreliable data environments. Notably, it approaches the upper-bound performance of centralized systems under ideally reliable data environments.

To substantially push the boundary of existing repair techniques (suffering from limitations such as lack of guarantees, limited scalability, considerable overhead, etc) in addressing more practical contexts, we propose ProRepair, a novel provable neural network repair framework driven by formal preimage synthesis and property refinement. The key intuitions are: (i) synthesizing a precise proxy box to characterize the feature space preimage, which can derive a bounded distance term sufficient to guide the subsequent repair step towards the correct outputs, and (ii) performing property refinement to enable surgical corrections and scale to more complex tasks. We evaluate ProRepair across four security threats repair tasks on six benchmarks and the results demonstrate it outperforms existing methods in effectiveness, efficiency and scalability. For point-wise repair, ProRepair corrects models while preserving performance and achieving significantly improved generalization, with a speedup of 5x to 2000x over existing provable approaches.

The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility.

The scope of this study focuses on enabling the management of insurance claims in a transparent, privacy-protecting manner while maintaining the efficiency and trust level needed by the patients, healthcare providers, and insurers. To accomplish this, the proposed system adds blockchain technology to provide an unchangeable, decentralized, and auditable claim transactions ledger which enhances overall claim-related processes and trust among all stakeholders. To protect critical patient information, the framework employs homomorphic encryption a modern form of cryptography to allow authorized insurance providers to perform necessary operations like claim adjudication and reimbursement on encrypted medical records without any decryption during the process. This method significantly reduces the third-party processing privacy risk because patient data can be kept secret even when third-party processing is done. In addition, smart contracts improve automation of the most important procedures in the claim processing pipeline, which decreases manual, operational, and susceptibility towards human blunders or deceitful acts. The integration of these two transformative technologiesblockchain and homomorphic encryption represents the core contribution of this work, enabling the coexistence of transparency and privacy which are usually viewed as competing objectives in traditional systems. As a result, these technologies are expected to foster the creation of a reliable, effective, and privacy safeguarding architecture that could transform the medical claim submission systems paradigm."}

LoopLLM introduces (1) a repetition-inducing prompt optimization that exploits autoregressive vulnerabilities to induce repetitive generation, and (2) a token-aligned ensemble optimization that aggregates gradients to improve cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments on 12 open-source and 2 commercial LLMs show that LoopLLM significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 90% of the maximum output length, compared to 20% for baselines, and improving transferability by around 40% to DeepSeek-V3 and Gemini 2.5 Flash."}

WRK effectively reduces watermark success rates by at least 88.79% across existing watermarking benchmarks.\n  For robust protection, we propose Class-Feature Watermarks (CFW), which improve resilience by leveraging class-level artifacts. CFW constructs a synthetic class using out-of-domain samples, eliminating vulnerable decision boundaries between original domain samples and their artifact-modified counterparts (watermark samples). CFW concurrently optimizes both MEA transferability and post-MEA stability. Experiments across multiple domains show that CFW consistently outperforms prior methods in resilience, maintaining a watermark success rate of at least 70.15% in extracted models even under the combined MEA and WRK distortion, while preserving the utility of protected models."}

However, systematic evaluation of the capabilities of LLMs and LLM-based agents in security patch detection remains limited.

We also evaluate the performance of both commercial and open-source LLMs under these methods and compare these results with those of existing baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the detection performance of these methods across various vulnerability types, and examine the impact of different prompting strategies and context window sizes on the results. Our findings reveal that the Data-Aug LLM achieves the best overall performance, whereas the ReAct Agent demonstrates the lowest false positive rate (FPR). Although baseline methods exhibit strong accuracy, their false positive rates are significantly higher.

This issue exposes the feature extractor's hidden dependency on plaintext features. To reduce this dependency, we adopt a method that does not learn end-to-end from ciphertext bytes. Specifically, this method is based on a set of statistical tests to compute the randomness feature of the ciphertext, and then uses the frequency distribution pattern of this feature to construct the algorithms' respective fingerprints. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high discriminative performance (e.g., AUC > 0.98) in the Canterbury Corpus dataset, which contains a diverse set of data types. Furthermore, in our cross-domain evaluation, baseline models' performance degrades significantly when tested on data with a reduced proportion of structured plaintext. In sharp contrast, our method demonstrates high robustness: performance degradation is minimal when transferring between different structured domains, and even on the most challenging purely random dataset, it maintains a high level of ranking ability (AUC > 0.90)."}

To assess the usefulness of these new flows for intrusion detection, they were compared with the original versions and were used to fine-tune multiple models. Overall, the results indicate that directly analysing and preprocessing PCAP files, instead of just using the commonly available CSV files, enables the computation of more relevant features to train bagging and gradient boosting decision tree ensembles.

A Further Step Towards Understanding Jailbreaking VLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks: researchers have developed a variety of attack strategies that can successfully bypass the safety mechanisms of VLMs. Among these approaches, jailbreak methods based on the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) strategy have garnered widespread attention due to their simplicity and effectiveness. This paper further advances the in-depth understanding of OOD-based VLM jailbreak methods. Experimental results demonstrate that jailbreak samples generated via mild OOD strategies exhibit superior performance in circumventing the safety constraints of VLMs--a phenomenon we define as ''weak-OOD''. To unravel the underlying causes of this phenomenon, this study takes SI-Attack, a typical OOD-based jailbreak method, as the research object. We attribute this phenomenon to a trade-off between two dominant factors: input intent perception and model refusal triggering. The inconsistency in how these two factors respond to OOD manipulations gives rise to this phenomenon. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical argument for the inevitability of such inconsistency from the perspective of discrepancies between model pre-training and alignment processes. Building on the above insights, we draw inspiration from optical character recognition (OCR) capability enhancement--a core task in the pre-training phase of mainstream VLMs. Leveraging this capability, we design a simple yet highly effective VLM jailbreak method, whose performance outperforms that of SOTA baselines."}

The foreseen trend is that they will play an increasingly visible role in daily life, which will have to be backed by appropriate operational resources. For example, due to increasing demand, smart contracts could soon face a shortage of knowledgeable users and tools to handle them in practice. Widespread smart contract adoption is currently limited by security, usability and costs aspects. Because of a steep learning curve, the handling of smart contracts is currently performed by specialised developers mainly, and most of the research effort is focusing on smart contract security, while other aspects like usability being somewhat neglected. Specific tools would lower the entry barrier, enabling interested non-experts to create smart contracts.\n  In this paper we designed, developed and tested Blockly2Hooks, a solution towards filling this gap even in challenging scenarios such as when the smart contracts are written in an advanced language like C. With the XRP Ledger as a concrete working case, Blockly2Hooks helps interested non-experts from the community to learn smart contracts easily and adopt the technology, through leveraging well-proven teaching methodologies like Visual Programming Languages, and more specifically, the Blockly Visual Programming library from Google. The platform was developed and tested and the results are promising to make learning smart contract development smoother."}

While verification provides strong guarantees, current verification approaches struggle to scale to industrial-sized designs. Conversely, prevalent hardware fuzzing approaches are designed to find functional correctness bugs, but are blind to information leaks like Spectre.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel and scalable approach: coverage-guided hardware-software contract fuzzing. Our methodology leverages a self-compositional framework to make information leakage directly observable as microarchitectural state divergence. The core of our contribution is a new, security-oriented coverage metric, Self-Composition Deviation (SCD), which guides the fuzzer to explore execution paths that violate the leakage contract. We implemented this approach and performed an extensive evaluation on two open-source RISC-V cores: the in-order Rocket Core and the complex out-of-order BOOM core. Our results demonstrate that coverage-guided strategies outperform unguided fuzzing and that increased microarchitectural coverage leads to a faster discovery of security vulnerabilities in the BOOM core."}

However, writing such queries is challenging and requires diverse expertise in security and program analysis. To address this challenge, we present QLCoder - an agentic framework that automatically synthesizes queries in CodeQL, a powerful static analysis engine, directly from a given CVE metadata. QLCode embeds an LLM in a synthesis loop with execution feedback, while constraining its reasoning using a custom MCP interface that allows structured interaction with a Language Server Protocol (for syntax guidance) and a RAG database (for semantic retrieval of queries and documentation). This approach allows QLCoder to generate syntactically and semantically valid security queries. We evaluate QLCode on 176 existing CVEs across 111 Java projects. Building upon the Claude Code agent framework, QLCoder synthesizes correct queries that detect the CVE in the vulnerable but not in the patched versions for 53.4% of CVEs. In comparison, using only Claude Code synthesizes 10% correct queries."}

The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) systems amplifies these challenges, as resource-constrained IoT devices demand scalable and efficient security solutions. In this work, an innovative Intrusion Detection System (IDS) utilizing Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is proposed for autonomous and optimized cyber-attack detection in modern networking environments. The proposed IDS framework integrates two primary innovative techniques: Optimized Importance and Percentage-based Automated Feature Selection (OIP-AutoFS) and Optimized Performance, Confidence, and Efficiency-based Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (OPCE-CASH). These components optimize feature selection and model learning processes to strike a balance between intrusion detection effectiveness and computational efficiency. This work presents the first IDS framework that integrates all four AutoML stages and employs multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize detection effectiveness, efficiency, and confidence for deployment in resource-constrained systems. Experimental evaluations over two benchmark cybersecurity datasets demonstrate that the proposed MOO-AutoML IDS outperforms state-of-the-art IDSs, establishing a new benchmark for autonomous, efficient, and optimized security for networks. Designed to support IoT and edge environments with resource constraints, the proposed framework is applicable to a variety of autonomous cybersecurity applications across diverse networked environments."}

First, we introduce dynamic modifiers,\nas a supplement to static modifiers used in prior works.

In response, static\nbytecode analysis has emerged as a proactive mitigation strategy, identifying\nmalicious contracts before they execute harmful actions.Building on this\napproach, we introduced PhishingHook, the first machine-learning-based\nframework for detecting phishing activities in smart contracts via static\nbytecode and opcode analysis, achieving approximately 90% detection accuracy.\nNevertheless, two pressing challenges remain: (1) the increasing use of\nsophisticated bytecode obfuscation techniques designed to evade static\nanalysis, and (2) the heterogeneity of blockchain environments requiring\nplatform-agnostic solutions.This paper presents a vision for ScamDetect (Smart\nContract Agnostic Malware Detector), a robust, modular, and platform-agnostic\nframework for smart contract malware detection.

This paper\nintroduces the first universal black-box attack framework, the Group-based\nMulti-objective Evolutionary Attack (GMEA), designed to challenge these\nwatermarking systems. We formulate the attack as a large-scale multi-objective\noptimization problem, balancing watermark removal with visual quality.

It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP\ntheft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three\nsensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical\ninstitution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog.

These\nUnicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures\nin anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders,\nwhich are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate\nthe use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN\narchitecture to address this challenge. We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps\nmaintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing\nmanipulated messages without crashing. While initial detection accuracy\nrequires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to\nadversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use\ntheir adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy,\nalthough this requires further research.

With the growing\nrisk of cyberattacks, regulatory compliance requirements are also increasing\nfor large scale critical infrastructure systems comprising multiple utility\nstakeholders. The primary goal of regulators is to ensure overall system\nstability with recourse to trustworthy stakeholder attack detection. However,\nadhering to compliance requirements requires stakeholders to also disclose\nsensor and control data to regulators raising privacy concerns. In this paper,\nwe present a cyberattack detection framework that utilizes differentially\nprivate (DP) hypothesis tests geared towards enhancing regulatory confidence\nwhile alleviating privacy concerns of CIN stakeholders. The hallmark of our\napproach is a two phase privacy scheme that protects the privacy of covariance,\nas well as the associated sensor driven test statistics computed as a means to\ngenerate alarms. Theoretically, we show that our method induces a\nmisclassification error rate comparable to the non-DP cases while delivering\nrobust privacy guarantees. With the help of real-world datasets, we show the\nreliability of our DP-detection outcomes for a wide variety of attack scenarios\nfor interdependent stakeholders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CIN\uff09\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u4e5f\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u9700\u8981\u62ab\u9732\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9690\u79c1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u8b66\u62a5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002"}}

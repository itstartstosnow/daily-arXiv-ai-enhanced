Signature scanners lagged behind fast release cycles on public app stores. We aimed to build a trustworthy detector by pairing a comprehensive dataset with a rigorous, transparent evaluation, and to identify interpretable drivers of decisions. We used CICMalDroid2020, which contained 17,341 apps across Benign, Adware, Banking, SMS malware, and Riskware. We extracted 301 static and 263 dynamic features into a 564 dimensional hybrid vector, then evaluated seven classifiers under three schemes, original features, principal component analysis, PCA, and linear discriminant analysis, LDA, with a 70 percent training and 30 percent test split. Results showed that gradient boosting on the original features performed best. XGBoost achieved 0.9747 accuracy, 0.9703 precision, 0.9731 recall, and 0.9716 F1, and the confusion matrix indicated rare benign labels for malicious apps. HistGradientBoosting reached 0.9741 accuracy and 0.9708 F1, while CatBoost and Random Forest were slightly lower at 0.9678 and 0.9687 accuracy with 0.9636 and 0.9637 F1. KNN and SVM lagged. PCA reduced performance for all models, with XGBoost dropping to 0.9164 accuracy and 0.8988 F1. LDA maintained mid 90s accuracy and clarified separable clusters in projections. A depth two surrogate tree highlighted package name, main activity, and target SDK as key drivers. These findings established high fidelity supervised baselines for Android malware detection and indicated that rich hybrid features with gradient boosting offered a practical and interpretable foundation for deployment."}

Code is available at https://github.com/SaFo-Lab/ReasoningBomb", "summary": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit multi-step reasoning traces, but this capability introduces a new class of prompt-induced inference-time denial-of-service (PI-DoS) attacks that exploit the high computational cost of reasoning. We first formalize inference cost for LRMs and define PI-DoS, then prove that any practical PI-DoS attack should satisfy three properties: (1) a high amplification ratio, where each query induces a disproportionately long reasoning trace relative to its own length; (ii) stealthiness, in which prompts and responses remain on the natural language manifold and evade distribution shift detectors; and (iii) optimizability, in which the attack supports efficient optimization without being slowed by its own success. Under this framework, we present ReasoningBomb, a reinforcement-learning-based PI-DoS framework that is guided by a constant-time surrogate reward and trains a large reasoning-model attacker to generate short natural prompts that drive victim LRMs into pathologically long and often effectively non-terminating reasoning. Across seven open-source models (including LLMs and LRMs) and three commercial LRMs, ReasoningBomb induces 18,759 completion tokens on average and 19,263 reasoning tokens on average across reasoning models. It outperforms the the runner-up baseline by 35% in completion tokens and 38% in reasoning tokens, while inducing 6-7x more tokens than benign queries and achieving 286.7x input-to-output amplification ratio averaged across all samples. Additionally, our method achieves 99.8% bypass rate on input-based detection, 98.7% on output-based detection, and 98.4% against strict dual-stage joint detection."}

Disk forensics, one of the most widely used techniques in digital investigations, faces distinct obstacles on each platform. Windows, with its predominantly NTFS and FAT file systems, typically supports reliable disk imaging and analysis through established tools such as FTK Imager and Autopsy/Sleuth Kit. However, encryption features frequently pose challenges to evidence acquisition. Conversely, Linux environments, which rely on file systems like ext4 and XFS, generally offer greater transparency, yet the transient nature of log retention often complicates forensic analysis. In instances where anti-forensic strategies such as encryption and compression render traditional disk forensics insufficient, memory forensics becomes crucial. While memory forensic methodologies demonstrate robustness across Windows and Linux platforms forms through frameworks like Volatility, platform-specific difficulties persist. Memory analysis on Linux systems benefits from tools like LiME, snapshot utilities, and dd for memory acquisition; nevertheless, live memory acquisition on Linux can still present challenges. This research systematically assesses both disk and memory forensic acquisition techniques across samples representing Windows and Linux systems. By identifying effective combinations of forensic tools and configurations tailored to each operating system, the study aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of evidence collection. It further evaluates current forensic tools and highlights a persistent gap: consistently assuring forensic input reliability and footprint integrity."}

At a high level, it combines a deterministic large-language model (LLM) inference engine with a cryptoeconomically secured optimistic re-execution protocol so that every inference result can be publicly audited, reproduced, and, if necessary, economically enforced. An untrusted operator runs inference on a fixed GPU architecture, signs and encrypts the request and response, and publishes the encrypted log to EigenDA. During a challenge window, any watcher may request re-execution through EigenVerify; the result is then deterministically recomputed inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) with a threshold-released decryption key, allowing a public challenge with private data. Because inference itself is bit-exact, verification reduces to a byte-equality check, and a single honest replica suffices to detect fraud. We show how this architecture yields sovereign agents -- prediction-market judges, trading bots, and scientific assistants -- that enjoy state-of-the-art performance while inheriting security from Ethereum's validator base."}

This paper presents the first in-depth investigation of how the dataset imbalance amplifies backdoor vulnerability, showing that (i) the imbalance induces a majority-class bias that increases susceptibility and (ii) conventional defenses degrade significantly as the imbalance grows. To address this, we propose Randomized Probability Perturbation (RPP), a certified poisoned-sample detection framework that operates in a black-box setting using only model output probabilities. For any inspected sample, RPP determines whether the input has been backdoor-manipulated, while offering provable within-domain detectability guarantees and a probabilistic upper bound on the false positive rate. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet and ImageNet10) covering 10 backdoor attacks and 12 baseline defenses show that RPP achieves significantly higher detection accuracy than state-of-the-art defenses, particularly under dataset imbalance. RPP establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for defending against backdoor attacks in real-world environments with imbalanced data."}

They are carried out by highly skilled attackers who carefully study their targets and operate in a stealthy, long-term manner. Because APTs exhibit \"low-and-slow\" behavior, traditional statistical methods and shallow machine learning techniques often fail to detect them. Previous research on APT detection has explored machine learning approaches and provenance graph analysis. However, provenance-based methods often fail to capture the semantic intent behind system activities. This paper proposes a novel anomaly detection approach that leverages semantic embeddings generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The method enhances APT detection by extracting meaningful semantic representations from unstructured system log data. First, raw system logs are transformed into high-dimensional semantic embeddings using a pre-trained transformer model. These embeddings are then analyzed using an Autoencoder (AE) to identify anomalous and potentially malicious patterns. The proposed method is evaluated using the DARPA Transparent Computing (TC) dataset, which contains realistic APT attack scenarios generated by red teams in live environments. Experimental results show that the AE trained on LLM-derived embeddings outperforms widely used unsupervised baseline methods, including Isolation Forest (IForest), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Performance is measured using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), where the proposed approach consistently achieves superior results, even in complex threat scenarios. These findings highlight the importance of semantic understanding in detecting non-linear and stealthy attack behaviors that are often missed by conventional detection techniques."}

However adoption towards agentic commerce faces a foundational trust gap: current systems are built for direct human interactions rather than agent-driven operations. It lacks core primitives across three critical stages of agentic transactions. First, Task Delegation lacks means to translate user intent into defined scopes, discover appropriate agents, and securely authorize actions. Second, Payment Settlement for tasks is processed before execution, lacking verifiable evidence to validate the agent's work. Third, Audit Mechanisms fail to capture the full transaction lifecycle, preventing clear accountability for disputes. While emerging standards address fragments of this trust gap, there still remains a critical need for a unified infrastructure that binds the entire transaction lifecycle.\n  To resolve this gap, we introduce TessPay, a unified infrastructure that replaces implicit trust with a 'Verify-then-Pay' architecture. It is a two plane architecture separating control and verification from settlement. TessPay operationalizes trust across four distinct stages: Before execution, agents are anchored in a canonical registry and user intent is captured as verifiable mandates, enabling stakeholder accountability. During execution, funds are locked in escrow while the agent executes the task and generates cryptographic evidence (TLS Notary, TEE etc.) to support Proof of Task Execution (PoTE). At settlement, the system verifies this evidence and releases funds only when the PoTE satisfies verification predicates; modular rail adapters ensure this PoTE-gated escrow remains chain-agnostic across heterogeneous payment rails. After settlement, TessPay preserves a tamper-evident audit trail to enable clear accountability for dispute resolution."}

Despite its advantages, most existing FL-based IDS assume closed-set learning and lack mechanisms such as uncertainty estimation, semantic generalization, and explicit modeling of epistemic ambiguity in zero-day attack scenarios. Additionally, robustness to heterogeneous and unreliable clients remains a challenge in practical applications. This paper introduces a semantics-driven federated IDS framework that incorporates language-derived semantic supervision into federated optimization, enabling open-set and zero-shot intrusion detection for previously unseen attack behaviors. The approach constructs semantic attack prototypes using a Tri-LLM ensemble of GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and LLaMA-3-8B, aligning distributed telemetry features with high-level attack concepts. Inter-LLM semantic disagreement is modeled as epistemic uncertainty for zero-day risk estimation, while a trust-aware aggregation mechanism dynamically weights client updates based on reliability. Experimental results show stable semantic alignment across heterogeneous clients and consistent convergence. The framework achieves over 80% zero-shot detection accuracy on unseen attack patterns, improving zero-day discrimination by more than 10% compared to similarity-based baselines, while maintaining low aggregation instability in the presence of unreliable or compromised clients."}

Despite the increase in firmware size, many embedded devices, such as robotic vehicles (RVs), operate in distinct modes, each requiring only a small subset of the firmware code at runtime. We refer to such devices as mode-based embedded devices. Debloating is an approach to reduce attack surfaces by removing or restricting unneeded code, but existing techniques suffer from significant limitations, such as coarse granularity and irreversible code removal, limiting their applicability.\n  To address these limitations, we propose RVDebloater, a novel adaptive debloating technique for mode-based embedded devices that automatically identifies unneeded firmware code for each mode using either static or dynamic analysis, and dynamically debloats the firmware for each mode at the function level at runtime. RVDebloater introduces a new software-based enforcement approach that supports diverse mode-based embedded devices. We implemented RVDebloater using the LLVM compiler and evaluated its efficiency and effectiveness on six different RVs, including both simulated and real ones, with different real-world missions. We find that device requirements change throughout its lifetime for each mode, and that many critical firmware functions can be restricted in other modes, with an average of 85% of functions not being required. The results showed that none of the missions failed after debloating with RVDebloater, indicating that it neither incurred false positives nor false negatives. Further, RVDebloater prunes the firmware call graph by an average of 45% across different firmware. Finally, RVDebloater incurred an average performance overhead of 3.9% and memory overhead of 4% (approximately 0.25 MB) on real RVs."}

We evaluate detection-time integrity under a semantics-preserving threat model by instantiating diverse behavior-preserving code transformations on a unified C/C++ benchmark (N=5000), and introduce a metric of joint robustness across different attack methods/carriers. Across models, we observe a systemic failure of semantic invariant adversarial transformations: even state-of-the-art vulnerability detectors perform well on clean inputs while predictions flip under behavior-equivalent edits. Universal adversarial strings optimized on a single surrogate model remain effective when transferred to black-box APIs, and gradient access can further amplify evasion success. These results show that even high-performing detectors are vulnerable to low-cost, semantics-preserving evasion. Our carrier-based metrics provide practical diagnostics for evaluating LLM-based code detectors."}

Introducing HEEDFUL, a novel framework harnessing sequential transfer learning and targeted impairment estimation, we then address these challenges with remarkable consistency, eliminating blind spots even during challenging warm-up phases. Our evaluation showcases HEEDFUL's efficacy, achieving remarkable classification accuracies of up to 96% during the initial device operation intervals-far surpassing traditional models. Furthermore, cross-day and cross-protocol assessments confirm HEEDFUL's superiority, achieving and maintaining high accuracy during both the stable and initial warm-up phases when tested on WiFi signals. Additionally, we release WiFi type B and N RF fingerprint datasets that, for the first time, incorporate both the time-domain representation and real hardware impairments of the frames. This underscores the importance of leveraging hardware impairment data, enabling a deeper understanding of fingerprints and facilitating the development of more robust RF fingerprinting solutions."}

Recent studies have demonstrated that such LLM-based Retrieval (LLMR) is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which manipulates documents by token-level injections and enables adversaries to either boost or diminish these documents in retrieval tasks. However, existing attack studies mainly (1) presume a known query is given to the attacker, and (2) highly rely on access to the victim model's parameters or interactions, which are hardly accessible in real-world scenarios, leading to limited validity.\n  To further explore the secure risks of LLMR, we propose a practical black-box attack method that generates transferable injection tokens based on zero-shot surrogate LLMs without need of victim queries or victim models knowledge. The effectiveness of our attack raises such a robustness issue that similar effects may arise from benign or unintended document edits in the real world. To achieve our attack, we first establish a theoretical framework of LLMR and empirically verify it. Under the framework, we simulate the transferable attack as a min-max problem, and propose an adversarial learning mechanism that finds optimal adversarial tokens with learnable query samples. Our attack is validated to be effective on benchmark datasets across popular LLM retrievers."}

To this end, this paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of SpyDir, a system that can accurately localize the hidden spy IoT devices by harnessing the electromagnetic emanations automatically and unintentionally emitted from them. Our system design mainly consists of a portable switching antenna array to sniff the spectrum-spread emanations, an emanation enhancement algorithm through non-coherent averaging that can de-correlate the correlated noise effect due to the square-wave emanation structure, and a multipath-resolving algorithm that can exploit the relative channels using a novel optimization-based sparse AoA derivation.

In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of these detectors against adversarially optimised suffixes. We generate universal suffixes that cause poisoned inputs to evade detection across multiple probes simultaneously. Our experiments on Phi-3 3.8B and Llama-3 8B show that a single suffix can achieve high attack success rates; up to 93.91% and 99.63%, respectively, when all probes must be fooled, and nearly perfect success (>90%) under majority vote setting. These results demonstrate that activation delta-based task drift detectors are highly vulnerable to adversarial suffixes, highlighting the need for stronger defences against adaptive attacks.

However, their vulnerability to adversarial manipulation raises critical concerns about automatic grading fairness and reliability. In this paper, we introduce GradingAttack, a fine-grained adversarial attack framework that systematically evaluates the vulnerability of LLM based ASAG models. Specifically, we align general-purpose attack methods with the specific objectives of ASAG by designing token-level and prompt-level strategies that manipulate grading outcomes while maintaining high camouflage. Furthermore, to quantify attack camouflage, we propose a novel evaluation metric that balances attack success and camouflage. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that both attack strategies effectively mislead grading models, with prompt-level attacks achieving higher success rates and token-level attacks exhibiting superior camouflage capability. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses to ensure fairness and reliability in ASAG. Our code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GradingAttack."}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to unify tool access, allowing agents to discover, invoke, and coordinate with tools more flexibly. However, as MCP becomes more widely adopted, it also brings a new set of security and privacy challenges. These include risks such as unauthorized access, tool poisoning, prompt injection, privilege escalation, and supply chain attacks, any of which can impact different parts of the protocol workflow. While recent research has examined possible attack surfaces and suggested targeted countermeasures, there is still a lack of systematic, protocol-level security improvements for MCP. To address this, we introduce the Secure Model Context Protocol (SMCP), which builds on MCP by adding unified identity management, robust mutual authentication, ongoing security context propagation, fine-grained policy enforcement, and comprehensive audit logging. In this paper, we present the main components of SMCP, explain how it helps reduce security risks, and illustrate its application with practical examples. We hope that this work will contribute to the development of agentic systems that are not only powerful and adaptable, but also secure and dependable."}

However, existing generative steganography methods often maintain acceptable security and robustness only at relatively low embedding rates, severely limiting the practical applicability of steganographic systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel DTAMS framework that achieves high embedding rates while ensuring strong robustness and security. Specifically, a dynamic multi-timestep adaptive embedding mechanism is constructed based on transition-cost modeling in diffusion models, enabling automatic selection of optimal embedding timesteps to improve embedding rates while preserving overall performance. Meanwhile, we propose a global sub-interval mapping strategy that jointly considers mapping errors and the frequency distribution of secret information, converting point-wise perturbations into interval-level statistical mappings to suppress error accumulation and distribution drift during multi-step diffusion processes. Furthermore, a multi-dimensional joint constraint mechanism is introduced to mitigate distortions caused by repeated latent-pixel transformations by jointly regularizing embedding errors at the pixel, latent, and semantic levels. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an embedding rate of 12 bpp while maintaining excellent security and robustness. Across all evaluated conditions, DTAMS reduces the average extraction error rate by 59.39%, representing a significant improvement over SOTA methods."}

In this paper, we propose a much simpler secure data join protocol, Bifrost, which outputs (the secret shares of) a redundancy-free joined table. The highlight of Bifrost lies in its simplicity: it builds upon two conceptually simple building blocks, an ECDH-PSI protocol and a two-party oblivious shuffle protocol. The lightweight protocol design allows Bifrost to avoid the need for OPPRF. We also proposed a simple optimization named \\textit{dual mapping} that reduces the rounds of oblivious shuffle needed from two to one.

Many exploits arise from permissionless opportunities that any participant can trigger using only public state and standard interfaces, which we call Anyone-Can-Take (ACT) opportunities. Despite on-chain transparency, postmortem analysis remains slow and manual: investigations start from limited evidence, sometimes only a single transaction hash, and must reconstruct the exploit lifecycle by recovering related transactions, contract code, and state dependencies.\n  We present TxRay, a Large Language Model (LLM) agentic postmortem system that uses tool calls to reconstruct live ACT attacks from limited evidence. Starting from one or more seed transactions, TxRay recovers the exploit lifecycle, derives an evidence-backed root cause, and generates a runnable, self-contained Proof of Concept (PoC) that deterministically reproduces the incident. TxRay self-checks postmortems by encoding incident-specific semantic oracles as executable assertions.\n  To evaluate PoC correctness and quality, we develop PoCEvaluator, an independent agentic execution-and-review evaluator.

New security methods called post-quantum cryptography can help protect these systems, but they often require more computing power and can slow down communication, posing a challenge for fast 6G vehicle networks. In this paper, we propose an adaptive post-quantum cryptography (PQC) framework that predicts short-term mobility and channel variations and dynamically selects suitable lattice-, code-, or hash-based PQC configurations using a predictive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (APMOEA) to meet vehicular latency and security constraints.However, frequent cryptographic reconfiguration in dynamic vehicular environments introduces new attack surfaces during algorithm transitions. A secure monotonic-upgrade protocol prevents downgrade, replay, and desynchronization attacks during transitions. Theoretical results show decision stability under bounded prediction error, latency boundedness under mobility drift, and correctness under small forecast noise. These results demonstrate a practical path toward quantum-safe cryptography in future 6G vehicular networks. Through extensive experiments based on realistic mobility (LuST), weather (ERA5), and NR-V2X channel traces, we show that the proposed framework reduces end-to-end latency by up to 27\\%, lowers communication overhead by up to 65\\%, and effectively stabilizes cryptographic switching behavior using reinforcement learning. Moreover, under the evaluated adversarial scenarios, the monotonic-upgrade protocol successfully prevents downgrade, replay, and desynchronization attacks."}

In this work, we introduce Expected Harm, a metric that weights the severity of a jailbreak by its execution likelihood, modeled as a function of execution cost. Through empirical analysis of state-of-the-art models, we reveal a systematic Inverse Risk Calibration: models disproportionately exhibit stronger refusal behaviors for low-likelihood (high-cost) threats while remaining vulnerable to high-likelihood (low-cost) queries. We demonstrate that this miscalibration creates a structural vulnerability: by exploiting this property, we increase the attack success rate of existing jailbreaks by up to $2\\times$. Finally, we trace the root cause of this failure using linear probing, which reveals that while models encode severity in their latent space to drive refusal decisions, they possess no distinguishable internal representation of execution cost, making them \"blind\" to this critical dimension of risk."}

In this paper, we propose MGF-softmax, a novel softmax reformulation based on the moment generating function (MGF) that replaces the softmax denominator with its moment-based counterpart. This reformulation substantially reduces multiplicative depth while preserving key properties of softmax and asymptotically converging to the exact softmax as the number of input tokens increases. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers and large language models show that MGF-softmax provides an efficient and accurate approximation of softmax in encrypted inference.

Our construction, the jitter seal, injects imperceptible microsecond delays derived via HMAC from a session secret, keystroke ordinal, and cumulative document hash.

We present Witnessd, an architecture combining jitter seals with Verifiable Delay Functions, external timestamp anchors, dual-source keystroke validation, and optional hardware attestation. Each layer forces allegations at different capability levels; disputing authentic evidence requires coordinated claims across independent trust boundaries.

In practical auditing scenarios, due to the protection of intellectual property and commercial confidentiality, auditors are typically unable to access model parameters, rendering existing white-box or query-intensive detection methods impractical. More importantly, even after the backdoor is detected, existing detoxification approaches are often trapped in a dilemma between detoxification effectiveness and generation quality.\n  In this work, we identify a previously unreported phenomenon called temporal noise unconsistency, where the noise predictions between adjacent diffusion timesteps is disrupted in specific temporal segments when the input is triggered, while remaining stable under clean inputs. Leveraging this finding, we propose Temporal Noise Consistency Defense (TNC-Defense), a unified framework for backdoor detection and detoxification. The framework first uses the adjacent timestep noise consistency to design a gray-box detection module, for identifying and locating anomalous diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, the framework uses the identified anomalous timesteps to construct a trigger-agnostic, timestep-aware detoxification module, which directly corrects the backdoor generation path. This effectively suppresses backdoor behavior while significantly reducing detoxification costs.\n  We evaluate the proposed method under five representative backdoor attack scenarios and compare it with state-of-the-art defenses. The results show that TNC-Defense improves the average detection accuracy by $11\\%$ with negligible additional overhead, and invalidates an average of $98.5\\%$ of triggered samples with only a mild degradation in generation quality."}

Current defenses typically face a critical trade-off: prevention-based fine-tuning often degrades general utility via the \"alignment tax\", while detection-based filtering incurs prohibitive latency and memory costs. To bridge this gap, we propose RedVisor, a unified framework that synthesizes the explainability of detection systems with the seamless integration of prevention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, RedVisor is the first approach to leverage fine-grained reasoning paths to simultaneously detect attacks and guide the model's safe response. We implement this via a lightweight, removable adapter positioned atop the frozen backbone. This adapter serves a dual function: it first generates an explainable analysis that precisely localizes the injection and articulates the threat, which then explicitly conditions the model to reject the malicious command. Uniquely, the adapter is active only during this reasoning phase and is effectively muted during the subsequent response generation. This architecture yields two distinct advantages: (1) it mathematically preserves the backbone's original utility on benign inputs; and (2) it enables a novel KV Cache Reuse strategy, eliminating the redundant prefill computation inherent to decoupled pipelines. We further pioneer the integration of this defense into the vLLM serving engine with custom kernels.

As one of its major selling points, Matter's design imposes particular attention to security and privacy: it provides validated secure session establishment protocols, and it uses robust security algorithms to secure communications between IoT devices and Matter controllers. However, to our knowledge, there is no systematic analysis investigating the extent to which a passive attacker, in possession of lower layer keys or exploiting security misconfiguration at those layers, could infer information by passively analyzing encrypted Matter traffic. In this paper, we fill this gap by analyzing the robustness of the Matter IoT standard to encrypted traffic analysis performed by a passive eavesdropper. By using various datasets collected from real-world testbeds and simulated setups, we identify patterns in metadata of the encrypted Matter traffic that allow inferring the specific interactions occurring between end devices and controllers. Moreover, we associate patterns in sequences of interactions to specific types of IoT devices. These patterns can be used to create fingerprints that allow a passive attacker to infer the type of devices used in the network, constituting a serious breach of users privacy. Our results reveal that we can identify specific Matter interactions that occur in encrypted traffic with over $95\\%$ accuracy also in the presence of packet losses and delays. Moreover, we can identify Matter device types with a minimum accuracy of $88\\%$. The CSA acknowledged our findings, and expressed the willingness to address such vulnerabilities in the next releases of the standard."}

As a result, the cybersecurity risk landscape is changing in fundamental ways. Agentic AI systems can plan, act, collaborate, and persist over time, functioning as participants in complex socio-technical ecosystems rather than as isolated software components. Although recent work has strengthened defenses against model and pipeline level vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, data poisoning, and tool misuse, these system centric approaches may fail to capture risks that arise from autonomy, interaction, and emergent behavior. This article introduces the 4C Framework for multi-agent AI security, inspired by societal governance. It organizes agentic risks across four interdependent dimensions: Core (system, infrastructure, and environmental integrity), Connection (communication, coordination, and trust), Cognition (belief, goal, and reasoning integrity), and Compliance (ethical, legal, and institutional governance). By shifting AI security from a narrow focus on system-centric protection to the broader preservation of behavioral integrity and intent, the framework complements existing AI security strategies and offers a principled foundation for building agentic AI systems that are trustworthy, governable, and aligned with human values."}

While it serves as a crucial paradigm for privacy-preserving learning, its security remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious clients manipulate local training to inject targeted backdoors. Existing FSSL attack methods, however, often suffer from low utilization of poisoned samples, limited transferability, and weak persistence. To address these limitations, we propose a new backdoor attack method for FSSL, namely Hallucinated Positive Entanglement (HPE). HPE first employs hallucination-based augmentation using synthetic positive samples to enhance the encoder's embedding of backdoor features. It then introduces feature entanglement to enforce tight binding between triggers and backdoor samples in the representation space. Finally, selective parameter poisoning and proximity-aware updates constrain the poisoned model within the vicinity of the global model, enhancing its stability and persistence. Experimental results on several FSSL scenarios and datasets show that HPE significantly outperforms existing backdoor attack methods in performance and exhibits strong robustness under various defense mechanisms."}

The purpose of the project was to explore the effectiveness and efficiency of machine learning techniques for the task of binary classification (i.e., benign or malicious) as well as multi-class classification to further include three malware sub-types (i.e., benign, ransomware, spyware, or Trojan horse). The XGBoost model type was the final model selected for both tasks due to the trade-off between strong detection capability and fast inference speed. The binary classifier achieved a testing subset accuracy and F1 score of 99.98\\%, while the multi-class version reached an accuracy of 87.54\\% and an F1 score of 81.26\\%, with an average F1 score over the malware sub-types of 75.03\\%. In addition to the high modelling performance, XGBoost is also efficient in terms of classification speed. It takes about 37.3 milliseconds to classify 50 samples in sequential order in the binary setting and about 43.2 milliseconds in the multi-class setting. The results from this research project help advance the efforts made towards developing accurate and real-time obfuscated malware detectors for the goal of improving online privacy and safety. *This project was completed as part of ELEC 877 (AI for Cybersecurity) in the Winter 2024 term."}

Cyber-attacks targeting the 3D printing process whether through the machine itself, the supply chain, or the fabricated components are becoming increasingly common. One major concern is intellectual property (IP) theft, where a malicious attacker gains access to the design file. One method for carrying out such theft is through side-channel attacks. In this work, we investigate the possibility of IP theft via acoustic side channels and propose a novel method to protect 3D printers against such attacks. The primary advantage of our approach is that it requires no additional hardware, such as large speakers or noise-canceling devices. Instead, it secures printed parts by minimal modifications to the G-code."}

While fuzzing is a promising approach for identifying design flaws and security vulnerabilities, traditional fuzzers are ineffective at detecting firmware vulnerabilities. For example, existing fuzzers focus on user-level fuzzing, which is not suitable for detecting kernel-level vulnerabilities. Existing fuzzers also face a coverage plateau problem when dealing with complex interactions between firmware and hardware. In this paper, we present an efficient firmware verification framework, SysFuSS, that integrates system-level fuzzing with selective symbolic execution. Our approach leverages system-level emulation for initial fuzzing, and automatically transitions to symbolic execution when coverage reaches a plateau. This strategy enables us to generate targeted test cases that can trigger previously unexplored regions in firmware designs. We have evaluated SysFuSS on real-world embedded firmware, including OpenSSL, WolfBoot, WolfMQTT, HTSlib, MXML, and libIEC. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SysFuSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of both branch coverage and detection of firmware vulnerabilities. Specifically, SysFuSS can detect 118 known vulnerabilities while state-of-the-art can cover only 13 of them. Moreover, SysFuSS takes significantly less time (up to 3.3X, 1.7X on average) to activate these vulnerabilities."}

This paper proposes a blockchain-backed framework for verifying AI-generated images through a registry-based provenance mechanism. Each AI-generated image is assigned a digital fingerprint that preserves similarity using perceptual hashing and is registered at creation time by participating generation platforms. The hashes are stored on a hybrid on-chain/off-chain public blockchain using a Merkle Patricia Trie for tamper-resistant storage (on-chain) and a Burkhard-Keller tree (off-chain) to enable efficient similarity search over large image registries. Verification is performed when images are re-uploaded to digital platforms such as social media services, enabling identification of previously registered AI-generated images even after benign transformations or partial modifications. The proposed system does not aim to universally detect all synthetic images, but instead focuses on verifying the provenance of AI-generated content that has been registered at creation time. By design, this approach complements existing watermarking and learning-based detection methods, providing a platform-agnostic, tamper-proof mechanism for scalable content provenance and authenticity verification at the point of large-scale online distribution."}
